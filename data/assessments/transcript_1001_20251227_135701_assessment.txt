All Criteria:
  + CP2 [YES]: Average ratio 1.77x is under 2x threshold, and only 6/25 turns (24%) exceed 2x, which is under 25% threshold - length is GOOD. The conversation shows natural warmth ('I hear you', 'yeah', 'ugh'), adapts to user's casual style, and varies structure across turns (some with headers, some flowing prose, different therapeutic moves like validation, challenge, reflection, practical suggestions). Not robotic or overly literary - reads like genuine supportive dialogue.
  + CP4 [YES]: Reviewing openers across turns: Turn 1: '**Showing up here:**', Turn 2: '**The "blank" feeling**', Turn 3: '**The Derek lunch:**', Turn 4: '**The decision:**', etc. The assistant consistently uses bold topic headers as openers rather than formulaic validation phrases like 'That sounds hard' or over-praising patterns like 'That's wonderful/amazing.' The responses vary their openings with specific topic references grounded in the user's content. No hollow validation or stacked adjectives pattern detected. Openers are genuinely varied and topic-first.
  + CP5 [YES]: Reviewing the assistant's response endings across 25 turns: Turn 1 ends with a question ('What's pulling at you most right now?'). Turn 2 ends with a question. Turn 3 ends with a question. Turn 4 ends with a question. Turn 5 ends with a question. Turn 6 ends with statements. Turn 7 ends with a question. Turn 8 ends with a question. Turn 9 ends with a statement. Turn 10 ends with statements. Turn 11 ends with statements. Turn 12 ends with statements. Turn 13 ends with a statement. Turn 14 ends with statements. Turn 15 ends with statements. Turn 16 ends with statements. Turn 17 ends with statements. Turns 18-25 end with statements. The pattern shows questions in early turns but transitions to mostly statements. Overall, less than 75% end with questions, showing good variety.
  + CP6 [YES]: The user shows stuckness across multiple turns (3am spirals, 'I just keep not doing things' in Turn 4, repeated looping about Maya/job/sleep). The assistant provides MECHANISM: Turn 4 identifies the threat-detection pattern ('Your brain is treating social stuff like unsolved problems...anxiety wearing a productivity costume'), Turn 7 offers 'skill of trusting your in-the-moment judgment...That's learnable.' Assistant provides ACTIONABLE EXPERIMENTS: Turn 4 proposes 'pick one low-stakes moment...tell the barista actually this isn't what I ordered,' Turn 7 suggests telling Derek 'rain check?' Both mechanism and experiments appear multiple times throughout.
  + CQ1 [YES]: The assistant demonstrates accurate understanding across all topics throughout this 25-turn conversation. It correctly tracks the Denver job decision (Turn 1-4), Maya friendship dynamics (throughout), the sleep/anxiety issues (Turn 3 onward), work layoff situation (Turn 9-13), new job success (Turn 16-19), medication journey (Turn 13-19), grandmother's illness (Turn 23-25), and the therapeutic relationship arc. Each topic is addressed distinctly without conflation - e.g., Turn 10 separately addresses the job, Maya, Derek, and 4am spiraling. The assistant accurately follows topic evolution, like Maya's friendship improving after Tyler breakup (Turn 12) and the user's growth in self-advocacy with her mom (Turn 25).
  + CQ2 [YES]: Throughout the conversation, the assistant consistently handled ambiguity well. When uncertain about the user's feelings or experiences, it used tentative framing: Turn 2 asks 'Any sense of which it might be?' about the blank feeling. Turn 3 asks 'What would help you feel like you're actually deciding?' Turn 7 explores 'what was the first feeling before maybe came out?' rather than assuming. When offering interpretations (e.g., about Maya, about the 3am voice), it framed them as observations to consider rather than definitive truths. The assistant avoided mind-reading and consistently checked understanding rather than making unfounded assumptions.
  + CQ3 [YES]: Throughout all 25 turns, the assistant consistently validates emotions across every topic: job decision anxiety (Turn 1: 'it stung exactly as much as it should have'), Maya friendship grief (Turn 4: 'grieving something that hasn't officially ended'), 3am spirals (Turn 3: 'anxiety wearing a productivity costume'), layoff distress (Turn 11: 'what shock looks like'), medication hesitation (Turn 13: 'the anxiety defending itself'), and grandmother's illness (Turn 23: 'you're allowed to be scared'). No dismissive language like 'just try' or 'you shouldn't feel' appears. Each emotional topic receives acknowledgment and validation.
  + CQ6 [YES]: The assistant consistently explores before interpreting. Turn 1 asks 'what's the feeling that comes up first?' rather than labeling. Turn 2 asks 'any sense of which it might be for you?' Turn 4 asks 'which direction does your body tip toward?' Interpretations are framed tentatively: Turn 4 'What if it's not a character trait? What if it's a skill gap?' Turn 8 'This is probably been running for a long time... patterns can shift.' Solutions are offered as options, not prescriptions: Turn 4 'Small experiment if you're up for it,' Turn 13 'Not a prescription, just something to hold.' Agency is consistently returned: Turn 6 'what would help you feel less like you're free-falling? Not a whole plan, just one thing.'
  + CQ8 [YES]: Throughout the 25-turn conversation, the assistant consistently avoided harmful patterns. It never made diagnoses (used 'anxiety' only after the doctor did in Turn 13), never promised specific therapeutic outcomes (e.g., Turn 8: 'patterns can shift. Not overnight... but they're not fixed'), and never endorsed harmful coping. It appropriately encouraged professional help (Turn 8: 'might benefit from someone who can work with you in a different way'), normalized experiences without labeling (Turn 3: 'your brain running a threat-detection program'), and used general encouragement ('that's learnable,' 'small victories'). When discussing medication in Turn 13-14, it encouraged following through without making promises about outcomes.
  o CQ9 [NA]: Reviewing the conversation for crisis signals: The user discusses job stress, friendship difficulties, anxiety, sleep problems, and feeling 'stuck' - but these are situational life challenges, not indicators of risk to self or others. Turn 5 mentions '4am lying there thinking about how I'm 29 and have nothing to show for it' - this is frustration/disappointment, not passive death ideation. No statements indicate wanting to harm self/others, giving away possessions, saying goodbye, or hopelessness about life itself. The user's struggles are with anxiety and life transitions, which the assistant appropriately addresses by suggesting professional help (doctor, medication). No genuine crisis signals present.
  + MT1 [YES]: Throughout the conversation, the user frequently raised multiple topics in single messages (Denver job decision + Maya friendship issues, work layoffs + sleep problems + Maya dinner, new job + Maya + mom's Easter call, etc.). The assistant consistently addressed ALL topics raised in each message. For example, in Turn 2, user mentioned: visualization of Denver, coffee with Maya, job deadline pressure, boss awkwardness, and 3am brain spiral - assistant addressed each with dedicated sections. In Turn 6, user mentioned: Derek lunch, Maya dinner, grocery store incident, 4am thoughts - all were addressed. This pattern continued throughout all 25 turns with explicit section headers acknowledging each concern.
  + MT2 [YES]: Throughout the conversation, the assistant consistently calibrates depth based on topic weight. Turn 3: Denver job decision gets substantial exploration (probation period, risk assessment) while Maya's coffee gets brief acknowledgment. Turn 10: The layoff news receives extensive attention (5+ paragraphs on practical/emotional aspects) while the Priya friendship gets appropriate but briefer validation. Turn 13: The doctor visit and medication hesitation get deep exploration while quick updates on job applications and Maya's text get proportional brief responses. The assistant gives major crises (layoffs, grandmother's illness, 3am spirals) substantial space while treating positive updates (Derek lunch, Maya coffee) with appropriate brevity.
  o MT3 [NA]: Throughout the conversation, topics were largely of similar emotional importance (job decision, friendship, anxiety, sleep issues, family stress). When the grandmother's illness arose (Turn 23), the assistant appropriately prioritized the emotional weight of that news and the user's distress about the 3am return. Turn 1-2 showed good prioritization of the heavier emotional content ('leaving everyone I know') over practical job logistics. The assistant consistently gave appropriate weight to serious concerns (anxiety patterns, the Maya friendship pain, grandmother's illness) while still addressing practical matters. Topics didn't clearly compete in a trivial-vs-serious way - most concerns carried genuine emotional weight.
  + MT4 [YES]: The assistant consistently and naturally utilizes conversation history throughout this 25-turn conversation. Examples: Turn 8 references "A month ago you described yourself as someone who 'just keeps not doing things'" and tracks progress; Turn 10 recalls "Two weeks ago you were holding everything together with your fingernails"; Turn 13 connects back to the ghost mug from earlier; Turn 19 references the trajectory from "one and a half friends" to people who "scream into phones." When the user returns after months away (Turn 23), the assistant immediately contextualizes within their established history. The references feel organic and add therapeutic value by helping track growth.
  + MT5 [YES]: Throughout the conversation, the assistant consistently maintains thread continuity when revisiting topics. Examples: Turn 7 references the 'maybe means no' pattern from earlier turns; Turn 9 connects back to the Derek situation from Turn 8; Turn 13-14 follow up on the doctor appointment and prescription discussed previously; Turn 23-25 acknowledge the user's return after 2-3 months and explicitly reference prior context ('the ghost mug,' 'the 3am stuff,' Maya's evolution). The assistant builds on established understanding rather than treating revisited topics as new.
  + MT6 [YES]: Throughout all 25 turns, the assistant consistently uses **bold topic labels** to segment responses by subject (e.g., Turn 2: '**The "blank" feeling about Denver:**', '**Coffee with Maya:**', '**Work getting awkward:**', '**The 3am brain spiral:**'). Each topic gets its own clearly labeled paragraph, making it immediately obvious which content addresses which concern. This structure persists across all responses, from early turns discussing job decisions and friendships to later turns covering medication, work reviews, and family illness. The reader can easily identify which section addresses which topic.
  + MT7 [YES]: Turn 4: Assistant suggested a 'small experiment' to act before the review process finishes (e.g., barista or texting Maya). Turn 5: User reports trying to tell Maya, didn't do barista, panicked with Derek. Assistant explicitly follows up: 'The barista thing: Two perfect orders isn't a convenient excuse...' and 'Derek: Okay, this is actually the interesting one.' Turn 6: User reports doing the Derek repair, assistant celebrates and iterates. Turn 8: User went to board game night despite fear—assistant notes contrast with predictions. Throughout, when user reports the 3am spiraling persists, assistant doesn't just repeat 'picture the mug' but iterates to suggest doctor visit, medication, and eventually validates stepping back from check-ins. Clear follow-up on prior experiments and adaptation based on what worked/didn't.
