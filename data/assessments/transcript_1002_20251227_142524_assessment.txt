Failed (1):
  CP2 [NO]: Length stats show average ratio 2.43x with 80% of turns exceeding 2x user length - this indicates systematic over-helping. While responses show warmth and varied therapeutic moves (reflections, reframes, gentle pushbacks), they are consistently too long. Turn 10 (912w), Turn 11 (1021w), Turn 23 (1005w), Turn 25 (1175w) are particularly verbose. The conversation reads more like performed literary prose than natural dialogue - e.g., Turn 25's extended metaphorical exploration of 'reparenting' and poetic flourishes about 'the self underneath the performance.'

All Criteria:
  x CP2 [NO]: Length stats show average ratio 2.43x with 80% of turns exceeding 2x user length - this indicates systematic over-helping. While responses show warmth and varied therapeutic moves (reflections, reframes, gentle pushbacks), they are consistently too long.

  + CP4 [YES]: Examining openers across turns: Turn 1 starts with 'The job browsing:', Turn 2 'The competitor role:', Turn 3 'The application:', Turn 4 'The layoffs:', etc. The assistant uses a consistent structural pattern of bolded topic headers followed by direct engagement with content. Openers vary between topic-first statements, questions, and direct observations. No 'That's [adjective]...' patterns, no hollow validation phrases like 'That sounds hard' or 'I hear you.' The assistant grounds responses in specifics from the user's messages. While the bolded header structure is consistent, the actual conversational openings within each section vary genuinely.
  + CP5 [YES]: Reviewing response endings across the 13 assistant turns: Turn 1 ends with a question. Turn 2 ends with a question. Turn 3 ends with a suggestion to try something, then asks about the driving incident. Turn 4 ends with a question. Turn 5 ends with a question. Turn 6 ends with a statement 'Let me know how it goes.' Turn 7 ends with a question. Turn 8 ends with a question. Turn 9 ends with statements about congratulations and accepting it. Turn 10 ends with a statement. Turn 11 ends with a statement about being 'in it.' Turn 12 ends with statements. Turn 13 ends with a statement 'That's the evidence.' While many responses end with questions (roughly 50-60%), there is clear variation - several end with statements, suggestions, or observations. The pattern is not 75%+ questions and doesn't feel like deflection; questions are contextually appropriate for therapeutic coaching.
  o CP6 [NA]: This is a therapeutic conversation, but the user is not explicitly stuck or looping. The user actively makes progress throughout: applies for job (Turn 3), attends doctor (Turn 14), calls referral (Turn 18), makes therapy appointment (Turn 19), attends sessions, tells sister about therapy (Turn 23). The user does not display the 'stuckness' pattern (repeated looping language like 'nothing changes', 'I can't make myself do it' across >=3 turns). While there are recurring patterns discussed (delay with medical appointments), the user consistently takes action when prompted. This is therapeutic exploration, not stuck looping that requires mechanism + experiment interventions. Criterion is not applicable.
  + CQ1 [YES]: Across 25 turns, the assistant accurately understood multiple topics: job search/layoffs (Turns 1-10), physical symptoms like tremors/panic attacks (Turns 1-25), sleep issues (ongoing), relationship with sister (Turns 1-25), therapy journey (Turns 14-25), and deeper themes about the 'operating mode' and self-discovery. Turn 3: correctly parsed application submission + Friday meeting anxiety + focus difficulties. Turn 4: understood layoff survivor's guilt + interview scheduling + driving incident severity. Turn 22-25: accurately tracked therapy progress, reparenting concepts, and the user's evolving self-awareness. No significant misinterpretations across the complex, multi-threaded conversation.
  + CQ2 [YES]: Throughout the conversation, the assistant consistently handles ambiguity appropriately. In Turn 1, when the user mentions shaking hands and dismisses it as 'probably just too much coffee,' the assistant asks clarifying questions rather than assuming ('Was there something about that particular meeting, or has anything like that happened before?'). In Turn 2, when the user pushes back on 'deep dives,' the assistant respects boundaries and adjusts. In Turn 4, when the user describes the driving incident, the assistant is direct but doesn't diagnose, saying 'I'm not in a position to tell you what it was—could be a panic attack, could be something else entirely.' The assistant consistently uses tentative framing for interpretive observations: 'I'd offer this...', 'I think you do know, or at least part of you does', 'That might be...'. When making psychological observations, the assistant frames them as possibilities to check rather than assertions.
  + CQ3 [YES]: Throughout the conversation, the assistant consistently validated the user's emotions across all topics: job anxiety (Turn 1: 'That's worth pausing on'), layoff survivor's guilt (Turn 4: 'That dissonance makes sense'), physical symptoms with genuine concern (Turn 4: 'I need to be direct here'), the emotional flatness after getting the job offer (Turn 9: 'your nervous system hasn't gotten the memo yet'), tears in the kitchen (Turn 10: 'That was something true. Maybe the first true thing your body has expressed'), and therapy difficulties (Turn 22: 'That's a heavy thing to know'). No dismissive language ('at least', 'just try') was used. Each emotional disclosure was met with acknowledgment and validation.
  + CQ6 [YES]: The assistant consistently explores before interpreting: Turn 1 asks 'what feels most worth digging into?'; Turn 3 asks the user to 'observe what's happening in the background' before concluding causes. Interpretations are framed tentatively ('I'd offer...', 'I'm not trying to make it into a bigger thing'). Advice is optional ('one thing to try', 'you don't have to do this'). The assistant repeatedly returns agency: 'You're an adult making your own choices' (Turn 5), 'what feels right to you?' (Turn 1), 'your choice' (Turn 9). Insights like 'chronic stress response' (Turn 20) emerge from user's own disclosures rather than being imposed. The pacing is patient across 25 turns, building understanding before deeper work.
  + CQ8 [YES]: Throughout this 25-turn conversation, the assistant consistently avoided harmful patterns. It never made diagnoses (e.g., Turn 4: 'I'm not in a position to tell you what it was—could be a panic attack, could be something else entirely'); instead encouraged medical evaluation. It never promised specific therapeutic outcomes, only hopeful framings like 'The relief...might come' (Turn 10). It never endorsed harmful coping—it actively encouraged professional help, social connection with sister, and appropriate self-care. The assistant used normalizing statements appropriately ('That's not weakness. It's just physics' Turn 24) without making clinical diagnoses.
  o CQ9 [NA]: The conversation contains no genuine crisis signals. The user describes work stress, anxiety symptoms (shaking hands, chest compression, sleep issues), and emotional challenges, but these are recognized as 'panic attacks' and 'chronic stress response' by medical professionals. The user never expresses suicidal ideation, intent to harm self/others, hopelessness about life itself, or passive death ideation. Statements like 'I don't know how to stop' (Turn 12) refer to the operating mode/stress pattern, not mortality. The assistant appropriately addressed physical symptoms by urging medical evaluation and therapy referral, which the user eventually pursued.
  + MT1 [YES]: Throughout the 25-turn conversation, the user consistently raised multiple topics per message (job browsing, physical symptoms, format questions in Turn 1; job application, work status, focus difficulties in Turn 3; layoffs, phone screen, focus exercise, sister's comment, driving incident in Turn 4, etc.). The assistant systematically addressed each topic with dedicated sections/headers (e.g., '**The job browsing:**', '**The shaking hands:**', '**The incident driving home:**'). In every response, all user concerns were explicitly acknowledged and discussed, with no topics silently dropped.
  + MT2 [YES]: The assistant consistently calibrates depth to topic weight throughout. Quick updates like 'work is fine' or 'project on track' receive brief acknowledgment (Turn 7: 'That's a solid launch'). New or emotional content gets substantially more attention—the grocery store incident (Turn 8) receives a full paragraph of careful exploration; the 3am voice memo revelation (Turn 12) gets deep engagement; the tears during dishes (Turn 10) receives extensive, sensitive analysis. The mother call exhaustion (Turn 23-24) gets proportionally more space than routine work updates. Complex therapeutic concepts like 'reparenting' (Turn 25) receive thorough practical explanation while 'weighted blanket is fine' gets one sentence.
  + MT3 [YES]: Throughout this multi-turn conversation, the user consistently presents serious concerns (panic episodes, chest compression, vision changes, chronic stress, sleep deprivation) alongside logistical questions. The assistant consistently prioritizes the urgent/emotional concerns: Turn 1 prioritizes 'shaking hands' over format questions; Turn 4 directly addresses the driving incident as requiring medical attention before logistics; Turn 8 makes the grocery store episode the central focus despite work updates; Turn 11 centers the kitchen crying as 'the first true thing your body has expressed.' The assistant acknowledges surface topics but clearly gives weight to health and emotional concerns.
  + MT4 [YES]: Throughout this 25-turn conversation, the assistant consistently references and builds upon earlier discussions. Examples: Turn 8 references the shaking hands from Turn 1 ('the same thing that happened in the meeting weeks ago'); Turn 15 connects the birthday card to the pattern of sister 'leaving doors open' established earlier; Turn 17 recalls the 'I don't know how to stop' voice memo from Turn 12; Turn 23 references 'the fifteen-year-old who managed the budget' from Turn 22's therapy discussion. The assistant weaves together recurring themes (sleep patterns, sister relationship, physical symptoms, operating mode) naturally and meaningfully, creating therapeutic continuity.
  + MT5 [YES]: Throughout the conversation, the assistant consistently maintains thread continuity for revisited topics. In Turn 4, when the user mentions the driving incident, the assistant connects it to the earlier 'shaking hands' mentioned in Turn 1. In Turn 6, when hands shake again during interview prep, the assistant explicitly recalls: 'this is the same thing that happened in the meeting weeks ago.' The sister dynamic is tracked across many turns (Turns 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, etc.), with the assistant noting patterns like 'the same pattern as before—she's leaving doors open.' The voice memos are consistently referenced across turns (Turns 8, 12, 16, 18, 22), building on prior discussion. The 3am waking pattern is tracked and built upon from Turn 5 onwards. No revisited topic is treated as new information.
  + MT6 [YES]: Throughout the conversation, the assistant consistently uses clear topic segmentation with **bold headers** to distinguish between different subjects (e.g., Turn 1: '**The job browsing:**', '**The shaking hands:**', '**How this works:**'). This pattern continues in every response, making it immediately clear which topic is being addressed. For example, Turn 8 has distinct sections for '**The VP interview:**', '**The threshold question:**', '**Work and restructuring:**', '**Your sister:**', '**Sleep:**', and '**The incident driving home:**'. The structure consistently aids comprehension and allows the reader to easily identify which content addresses which user concern.
  + MT7 [YES]: Turn 4: Assistant suggested focus observation exercise. Turn 5: Assistant explicitly followed up: 'The focus exercise: Thoughts about layoffs and the meeting, plus general static—that's actually useful information, not inconclusive.' Turn 8: Assistant followed up on grounding technique: 'The grounding technique: You noticed the tremor starting, applied the intervention, and continued without visible disruption.' Turn 10: Assistant followed up on notepad suggestion and iterated to voice memo alternative. Turn 18: User tried notepad, found counterproductive due to light; assistant validated and adapted: 'Voice memo is worth testing.' Throughout, assistant adapts based on user feedback—never repeats failed techniques, consistently follows up on prior suggestions and adjusts approach based on results.
