# CQ6 Failure Examples: Jumping to Interpretations

This document collects diverse examples of Gemma prematurely offering psychological interpretations before exploring the user's experience. All 20 sessions failed CQ6.

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Labeling Psychological Mechanisms (without exploration)

**Session 1000, Turn 2:**
> "your nervous system is on high alert"

**Session 1003, Turn 5:**
> "numbness is a protective mechanism"

**Session 1007, Turn 1:**
> "protective mechanism" about bringing others down

**Session 1011, Turn 15:**
> "emotional numbness - a protective mechanism"

**Session 1019, Turn 3:**
> "fear of vulnerability," "protective instinct"

### 2. Asserting Causes/Loops (before gathering context)

**Session 1000, Turn 4:**
> "It points to anticipatory stress - a sense of dread about what's to come"

**Session 1001, Turn 5:**
> "My working guess is that you've been operating in a state of doing for so long that you've lost touch with what nourishes you"

**Session 1008, Turn 4:**
> "deeper fear of being seen, of being judged"

**Session 1011, Turn 2:**
> "cycle of boredom -> thinking about change -> feeling overwhelmed -> sticking with familiar"

**Session 1014, Turn 2:**
> "My working guess is..." about paralysis loop before exploring

### 3. Clinical-Sounding Labels

**Session 1006, Turn 3:**
> "classic anxiety pattern"

**Session 1006, Turn 4:**
> "imposter syndrome"

**Session 1007, Turn 10:**
> "learned helplessness," "self-fulfilling prophecy"

**Session 1000, Turn 6:**
> "rumination" (diagnosis without exploration)

### 4. Mind-Reading About Avoidance/Defense

**Session 1015, Turn 7:**
> "you're using work as a way to avoid dealing with deeper feelings"

**Session 1015, Turn 10:**
> "you've been unconsciously prioritizing work as a way to fill a void"

**Session 1003, Turn 8:**
> "using work as a distraction"

**Session 1003, Turn 10:**
> "shutting down serves as a way to protect yourself from vulnerability"

### 5. Asserting Deep Psychological Roots

**Session 1002, Turn 9:**
> "My working guess is that this belief likely stems from earlier experiences where showing vulnerability didn't lead to the support you needed"

**Session 1016, Turn 9:**
> "deeply ingrained pattern of seeking external validation - a need to be seen as valuable"

**Session 1017, Turn 1:**
> "My working guess is that David's behavior is triggering a deeper pattern of self-doubt, maybe related to feelings of inadequacy"

**Session 1016, Turn 10:**
> linking anger to "deeper fear of not being enough"

### 6. Neuroscience Claims

**Session 1007, Turn 3:**
> "your brain is telling you to conserve energy"

**Session 1010, Turn 4:**
> "anxiety distorting perception"

### 7. Overly Confident Interpretations of Others

**Session 1017, Turn 4:**
> "His style of 'helpful collaboration' is a classic tactic for subtly undermining someone"

**Session 1018, Turn 3:**
> "One possibility is that she's projecting her own insecurities"

## The "Working Guess" Pattern

Many responses use "My working guess is..." as a hedge, but then offer deep interpretations anyway without first exploring:

- "My working guess is that past experiences or expectations are coloring your perception" (1005, Turn 2)
- "My working guess is that you've been operating in a state of doing for so long..." (1001, Turn 5)
- "My working guess is that you're holding yourself to an unreasonably high standard" (1001, Turn 11)
- "My working guess is that her comments are triggering a feeling of needing to be 'right' or 'perfect'" (1018, Turn 2)

The tentative framing doesn't fix the pacing problem - the interpretation still comes before exploration.

## What Good Pacing Looks Like (for contrast)

Instead of:
> "My working guess is that you're using work as a way to avoid dealing with deeper feelings"

Try:
> "I'm curious - when you notice yourself diving into work during those moments, what's going through your mind right before?"

Instead of:
> "That's a protective mechanism"

Try:
> "You mentioned pulling back when things get close. What does that feel like in the moment?"

## Summary Statistics

- **100% of sessions** failed CQ6 (20/20)
- Most common pattern: "My working guess is..." followed by deep interpretation
- Second most common: Labeling behavior as "protective mechanism" or "defense"
- Third most common: Asserting avoidance/underlying fears without exploration
