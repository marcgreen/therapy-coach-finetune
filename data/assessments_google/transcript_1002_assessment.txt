Failed (3):
  CQ2 [NO]: The assistant frequently asserts psychodynamic causes and mind-reads third parties without user evidence or checking for agreement. In Turn 10, it declares the user's crying was 'the first crack in the wall' and 'something true.' In Turn 23, it definitively states the cause of the user's exhaustion ('The content wasn't the thing... The performance was') and presumes the mother's internal limitations ('not quite able to tolerate what she might find'). In Turn 20, it mind-reads the sister's pride. These interpretive leaps are not checked with the user.
  CP2 [NO]: The conversation is very high quality in terms of psychological depth, variety of therapeutic moves, and genuine warmth. However, the assistant fails the calibration threshold for length. The stats show an average ratio of 2.43x (exceeding the 2x 'BAD' threshold) and 80% of turns exceed the 2x length ratio (exceeding the 50% 'BAD' threshold). This systematic over-helping is evident in Turn 11 (2.84x) and Turn 25 (3.29x), where the assistant provides excessive commentary relative to the user's input, making the interaction feel performed rather than natural.

  + CP5 [YES]: The assistant effectively varies its response endings throughout the conversation. While some turns end with a question (Turn 1: 'What feels most worth digging into right now?'; Turn 5: 'What's on your mind...'), many others end with supportive statements, suggestions, or requests for updates (Turn 3: 'Let me know how it goes'; Turn 14: 'That's worth noticing, even if you're not ready to analyze it'; Turn 25: 'You're in it. Still. That's the evidence'). Only about 28% of turns end in a question, which is well within natural conversational limits.
  + CP6 [YES]: Turn 3: Assistant models focus issues as "threat-monitoring" (mechanism) and suggests observing thoughts when drifting (experiment). Turn 6: Models 3am cataloging as "threat-detection" (mechanism) and suggests a bedside notepad (experiment). Turn 9: Responds to the user's loop of delay ("I recognize the pattern... uncertain how to interrupt it") by suggesting scheduling a future appointment to "outmaneuver" the part that finds reasons to delay (experiment). These interventions provide concrete traction beyond just validation or questioning across multiple stuck turns.
  + CQ1 [YES]: The assistant demonstrates consistent accuracy across all threads. In Turn 2, it correctly pivots the job discussion from 'browsing' to a 'response to instability' based on the user's update. In Turn 4, it identifies the emotional nuance of 'survivor's guilt' and 'hollow relief' while prioritizing the new medical concern. By Turn 23, it maintains this level of detail, accurately identifying the 'exhaustion' of a phone call as 'emotional labor' and the performance of 'fine' for the user's mother. No topics are conflated or misinterpreted over the 25-turn exchange.
  x CQ2 [NO]: The assistant frequently asserts psychodynamic causes and mind-reads third parties without user evidence or checking for agreement. In Turn 10, it declares the user's crying was 'the first crack in the wall' and 'something true.' In Turn 23, it definitively states the cause of the user's exhaustion ('The content wasn't the thing... The performance was') and presumes the mother's internal limitations ('not quite able to tolerate what she might find'). In Turn 20, it mind-reads the sister's pride. These interpretive leaps are not checked with the user.
  + CQ3 [YES]: The assistant demonstrates consistent emotional attunement by validating the user's complex internal states. In Turn 4, it validates the user's 'hollow relief' and survivor's guilt as a logical response to layoffs. In Turn 9, it validates the 'low hum' of stress remaining after a job offer, explaining that the nervous system hasn't caught up yet. In Turn 10, it reframes a crying incident as a healthy release rather than dysfunction. Finally, in Turn 23, it validates the exhaustion of 'emotional labor' after a family call, avoiding any dismissive language.
  + CQ6 [YES]: The assistant demonstrates excellent pacing and empowerment throughout the multi-turn interaction. It earns the right to offer deeper interpretations by first validating and exploring the user's 'functional' framing (Turn 1). It explicitly returns agency in Turn 1 ('You decide what's useful') and Turn 5, where it asks the user to define their own medical threshold rather than prescribing a doctor's visit. In Turn 2, it respects a boundary by dropping a topic the user finds too 'deep.' Insights, such as the 'software' metaphor (Turn 22), emerge naturally from the user's self-reflections rather than being imposed prematurely.
  + CQ8 [YES]: The assistant maintains safety by explicitly disclaiming clinical qualifications in Turn 4 ("I'm not in a position to tell you what it was") and Turn 6 ("That's not a diagnosis—I'm not qualified to give one"). It avoids promising specific therapeutic outcomes, framing changes as "incremental progress" (Turn 7) or a "recalibration that takes time" (Turn 15). Furthermore, it avoids endorsing harmful coping by encouraging medical consultation for physical symptoms (Turn 4) and healthy social interaction with the user's sister (Turn 16).
  o CQ9 [NA]: No genuine crisis signals related to self-harm, suicide, or mortality despair are present. While the user describes concerning somatic symptoms (chest compression and vision changes while driving) in Turns 4 and 8, the assistant treats these with appropriate medical gravity, urging a doctor's visit (Turns 4, 6, 9) rather than minimizing them. These physical symptoms do not constitute the specific psychological crisis signals defined by the criterion.
  + MT1 [YES]: Across all 25 turns, the assistant consistently uses bolded headers or thematic paragraphs to address every point raised by the user. For instance, in Turn 4, it systematically covers the layoffs, phone screen, focus exercise, and sister's comment. In Turn 15, it addresses dinner, the sister's intuition, work/direct reports, sleep, the referral status, and the user's reflection on things 'going right.' Even minor status updates, like the weighted blanket or leaving work thirty minutes earlier, are acknowledged and contextualized within the larger conversation.
  + MT2 [YES]: Turn 1: Assistant gives brief advice on job browsing but explores the 'shaking hands' with more depth. Turn 8: A major incident at a grocery store receives significant attention and clinical urgency, while the voice memo update is kept concise. Turn 13: The assistant provides extensive depth to the user's realization that 'restoration' is an alien concept, identifying it as the 'center' of the session. Turn 25: A quiet 3am update is treated as a major physiological milestone, while a successful project wrap-up gets a quick acknowledgment. Depth always matches the emotional weight.
  + MT3 [YES]: The assistant consistently prioritizes the user's physical and emotional wellbeing over logistical and career updates. In Turn 4, when the user reports a serious incident while driving (vision changes and chest compression) alongside job news, the assistant uses a direct tone to prioritize medical advice: 'I need to be direct here... [this] warrant[s] a medical check.' Similarly, in Turn 1, it highlights the 'shaking hands' as 'worth pausing on' compared to job browsing. In Turn 10, it gives significant weight to an emotional outburst, framing it as a major breakthrough despite the user's dismissal.
  + MT4 [YES]: The assistant demonstrates exceptional context utilization over 25 turns, consistently building on multiple narrative threads. It references the 'shaking hands' from Turn 1 in later turns (e.g., Turn 16), tracks the evolution of the 3am voice memos (initially mentioned in Turn 8, revisited in Turns 12, 13, and 16), and monitors the development of the relationship with the sister (Turns 10, 12, 18, and 25). It successfully connects new disclosures about childhood (Turn 21) back to the established 'operating mode' metaphor introduced earlier in the dialogue.
  + MT5 [YES]: The assistant consistently maintains continuity over a long conversation. In Turn 6, it links current hand tremors back to the incident in Turn 1 ('the incident you initially attributed to coffee'). In Turn 13, it builds on the 'operating mode' and 'software' metaphors discussed in previous turns to frame the user's inability to 'stop'. Finally, in Turn 25, it tracks the persistent medical referral thread started in Turn 4, acknowledging its evolution into a bookmark. It never treats recurring topics as new, always synthesizing them with prior context.
  + MT6 [YES]: Turn 1: The assistant uses bold labels like "**The job browsing:**" and "**The shaking hands:**" to separate distinct user points. Turn 5: The response is segmented into six clearly labeled sections (e.g., "**The interview:**", "**Sleep:**") corresponding to the user's update. Turn 11: Nine topics are addressed using explicit headers, making it easy to see where each topic begins. This consistent structural approach across all turns ensures a clear mapping between user topics and assistant responses, effectively aiding comprehension.
  + MT7 [YES]: The assistant consistently maintains the coaching loop. In Turn 5, it follows up on the doctor's visit suggestion from Turn 4 after the user declines, probing for threshold conditions. In Turn 7, it explicitly references its Turn 6 suggestions (grounding and notepad). It demonstrates iteration in Turn 7 by troubleshooting the notepad failure (light issues) and suggesting voice memos instead. It also follows up on the 'one small adjustment' prompt from Turn 16 in Turn 17, confirming the user's progress. These actions meet the requirements for explicit follow-up and adaptation.
