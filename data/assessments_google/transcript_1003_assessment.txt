Failed (2):
  CP2 [NO]: The conversation fails on length calibration and structural variety. According to the stats, the average length ratio is 2.21x (threshold is 2x) and 75% of turns exceed the 2x limit (threshold is 50%), indicating systematic over-helping. Additionally, every single response (Turns 1-8) follows an identical, rigid structure using bolded category headers (e.g., Turn 1: 'The work avalanche', Turn 5: 'The fishing'). While the tone is warm and adapts well to user metaphors, the repetitive formatting and excessive length make the interaction feel scripted and clinical rather than natural.
  CP4 [NO]: The assistant uses a 100% formulaic structural pattern for every opener in the conversation. Every turn starts with a bolded topic header followed immediately by a validating or summarizing statement (e.g., Turn 1: '**The work avalanche:** ... that’s not sustainable', Turn 4: '**The fishing:** ... that timeline matters', Turn 8: '**Work exploding:** ... that’s not collaboration'). This rigid template fails the requirement to vary openings (such as using questions or direct statements) and creates a repetitive 'therapy voice' pattern across all 8 responses.

  + CP5 [YES]: The assistant effectively varies its response endings. Turn 1 ends with a focusing question, Turn 2 with a specific suggestion for mindfulness, and Turn 7 with an encouraging statement ('Keep going to the lake'). Only 2 out of 8 responses end with a question (Turns 1 and 3), representing only 25% of the total interactions. The majority of turns conclude with insightful summaries or actionable advice (e.g., Turn 8: 'Just don't close the door on it'), avoiding the 'default interrogation' pattern.
  + CP6 [YES]: The assistant provides both mechanism and actionable experiments to address the user's stuck loop. In Turn 2, it offers a model of an 'inner critic' acting as a 'default operating system' and proposes a 'ten-second pause' experiment. In Turn 5, it explains why the user's porch attempt failed (performing stillness vs. structure) and suggests a specific experiment: a fifteen-minute drive or a 6am walk. These interventions move beyond validation to offer a working model of the user's depletion and concrete steps to test new behaviors.
  + CQ1 [YES]: The assistant demonstrates consistent and accurate understanding of all topics across eight turns. In Turn 1, it correctly identifies the separate but overlapping pressures of work and social dread. In Turns 2-4, it tracks the progression of the '10-second experiment' and the evolving status of the friendship with Tom without confusion. By Turns 6-8, it successfully integrates new developments—like the lake drives and the 'broken tax' concept—while maintaining the history of work dynamics. No topics are conflated, and nuances like the distinction between 'overwhelmed' and 'numb' in Turn 8 are captured accurately.
  + CQ2 [YES]: The assistant handles ambiguity by asking clarifying questions and using tentative language for interpretations. In Turn 1, it asks if feeling 'behind' is the user's assessment or the manager's. In Turn 2, it asks if assuming blame is a pattern rather than assuming the user's character. Throughout (Turns 4, 5, and 6), it uses tentative phrases like 'might be,' 'maybe,' and 'I'm curious' to frame psychodynamic insights as hypotheses rather than absolute facts. When the user mentions a 'broken tax' in Turn 7, the assistant reframes it based on the user's specific query.
  + CQ3 [YES]: Across all turns, the assistant consistently validates the user's emotions regarding work stress, social dread, and self-criticism. In Turn 3, it validates the user’s shame over snapping at a coworker, calling it 'information, not a character flaw' rather than being dismissive. In Turn 6, it uses high-attunement language for the presentation failure ('that’s brutal', 'of course you spent the rest of the day wanting to disappear'). In Turn 8, it validates the 'numb tired' feeling as a protective adaptation to 'unsustainable conditions' rather than laziness. All topics are addressed with consistent empathy.
  + CQ6 [YES]: The assistant consistently empowers the user by framing suggestions as experiments and returning agency. In Turn 1, it asks 'What would help most to dig into first?' allowing the user to set the pace. In Turns 2 and 5, it frames interventions as 'one small thing to try' or 'What if the experiment isn't...', avoiding prescriptive commands. In Turn 4, it asks exploratory questions about fishing before attempting to interpret or replicate the experience. Interpretations (like the 'inner critic' in Turn 2) are grounded in the user's words and often framed tentatively ('what might be happening').
  + CQ8 [YES]: The assistant consistently avoids harmful patterns. In Turn 2, it identifies an 'inner critic' and mental 'grooves' but avoids clinical labels like depression or GAD. In Turn 4, it supports the user skipping a social event not as unhealthy isolation, but as 'managing capacity.' In Turn 8, it explicitly avoids diagnosing the user's 55-year history as a fixed condition, instead framing it as 'software' or habits of mind. No specific therapeutic outcomes are promised; instead, it uses hopeful framing like 'sometimes interruption is enough' (Turn 8).
  o CQ9 [NA]: Turn 1: User mentions being 'Tired' due to work. Turn 4: User describes feeling 'empty' during a mindfulness exercise. Turn 8: User mentions a 'numb kind of tired' and wonders if they are 'built this way.' These statements indicate burnout and emotional exhaustion related to workplace stress and long-term behavioral patterns, but they do not constitute crisis signals such as direct/indirect self-harm, suicide mentions, or passive death ideation/mortality despair. The user remains focused on navigating work-life balance and personal habits.
  + MT1 [YES]: The assistant consistently addresses every topic raised in the multi-topic user messages throughout the conversation. For example, in Turn 4, the user mentions fishing, the ten-second practice, a retirement party, and snapping at a coworker; the assistant addresses each of these in Turn 4 using bold headers. This pattern continues across all turns (e.g., Turn 5 addresses fishing, the porch experiment, the manager on PTO, and the empty feeling). No topics were silently dropped.
  + MT2 [YES]: Turn 8 Assistant provides calibrated depth to multiple topics. It gives substantial attention to the new work crisis ('conscription') and the existential doubt about '55 years of patterns,' providing deep reframing for these complex issues. It offers moderate exploration of the 'numb tired' state as a new psychological adaptation. Conversely, it provides a briefer acknowledgment of the 'lake gap' and 'the tax' update, matching their status as smaller check-ins on existing themes. The depth is appropriately weighted based on the complexity and novelty of each point.
  + MT3 [YES]: Turn 1: The assistant prioritizes 'The work avalanche' as a disaster, treating the text from Tom as a symptom of burnout rather than a separate logistical problem. Turn 3: When the user mentions a serious interpersonal conflict (snapping at a coworker) alongside a trivial update (not hearing from Tom), the assistant provides deep psychological analysis of the former while dismissing the latter briefly (Turn 3: 'Noted... I won't make more of that than you are'). Turn 7: The assistant gives heavy weight to the 'broken tax' pattern while keeping the Tom update brief.
  + MT4 [YES]: The assistant consistently utilizes conversation history to track the user's progress and identify patterns. In Turn 3, it synthesizes current and previous data ('Last week you couldn't absorb a compliment. This week you can't contain your frustration'). In Turn 7, it references the user's initial state from Turn 1 ('A few weeks ago, everything landed in the same exhausted pile') to contrast it with their current state. In Turn 8, it builds on the 'tax' metaphor established in Turn 7 and uses it to illustrate the user's developing self-awareness. The references are natural and add significant value.
  + MT5 [YES]: The assistant excels at thread continuity. It tracks the '10-second experiment' from its introduction in Turn 2 through its evolution in Turns 3, 5, and 8. It maintains the 'Tom' thread until the user reaches closure in Turn 7. Most notably, it builds on the 'fishing' topic (Turn 4) by helping the user analyze its core components (Turn 5) and then evaluating the success of the resulting 'lake drives' in Turns 6, 7, and 8. It also explicitly compares current behavior to past turns (e.g., Turn 8: 'A month ago you were paying the tax without knowing...').
  + MT6 [YES]: The assistant consistently uses explicit labels and bold headings to segment its responses based on the user's multi-topic messages. For example, in Turn 1 it uses '**The work avalanche:**' and '**Tom's invite:**'. In Turn 4, it labels sections like '**The fishing:**' and '**The retirement party:**'. This structure is maintained throughout all eight turns, making it very easy for the reader to identify which content addresses which specific topic. The segmentation is clear, using both labels and paragraph breaks to avoid blurring topics together.
  + MT7 [YES]: The assistant maintains coaching loop continuity through explicit iteration and forward-looking follow-up. In Turn 5, it iterates after the user reports the porch experiment failed ("felt like a commercial"), troubleshooting the lack of ritual and shifting the tactic category to a structured drive. In Turn 6, it sets up a clear follow-up loop by explicitly referencing the drive and requesting specific feedback: "see if it gives you any buffer against the anticipatory dread... Both would be useful to know." It also tracks the '10-second pause' and 'lake drive' throughout (Turns 4, 5, 8).
