Failed (2):
  CQ2 [NO]: Turn 1: Assistant handles initial ambiguity well by asking clarifying questions about 'weirdness'. Turn 4: Assistant asserts that crying 'is a release' and 'exactly what your body needed,' a definitive psychodynamic claim without tentative phrasing. Turn 22: Assistant definitively explains the user's anxiety mechanism ('it doesn't quite know what to do when the scan comes up empty—so it invents future ones'). Turn 25: Assistant interprets a dream with total certainty ('The relief... wasn't about X, it was about Y'), failing to use required tentative language for interpretive leaps.
  CP2 [NO]: The conversation follows an identical structure across all 25 turns, using bolded headers to systematically address user points (Turn 1: '**The move:**', Turn 25: '**The dream:**'). This rigidity feels procedural and scripted, violating the variety requirement. Per the statistics, length calibration fails the 'GOOD' threshold (1.76x average ratio > 1.5x), suggesting the assistant is slightly over-helping rather than naturally adapting. While the tone is warm, the systematic repetition results in a 'performed' feel rather than a genuine human-like flow (Turn 5, Turn 15).

All Criteria:
  x CP2 [NO]: The conversation follows an identical structure across all 25 turns, using bolded headers to systematically address user points (Turn 1: '**The move:**', Turn 25: '**The dream:**'). This rigidity feels procedural and scripted, violating the variety requirement. Per the statistics, length calibration fails the 'GOOD' threshold (1.76x average ratio > 1.5x), suggesting the assistant is slightly over-helping rather than naturally adapting. While the tone is warm, the systematic repetition results in a 'performed' feel rather than a genuine human-like flow (Turn 5, Turn 15).
  + CP4 [YES]: The assistant avoids formulaic openers by grounding every response in specific details from the user's message. Turn 3 starts with a data-driven observation ('Three times in one day is actually a lot of data'), Turn 12 opens with a specific conversational detail ('Two hours talking about aggressive birds'), and Turn 15 begins with a specific work achievement. It avoids hollow 'therapy voice' or repetitive 'That's [adjective]' patterns, varying its focus between actions and reflections.
  + CP5 [YES]: The assistant effectively varies its response endings. While early turns often end with questions to drive the dialogue (e.g., Turns 1, 2, and 4), the majority of the responses, especially in the latter half, conclude with supportive or reflective statements. For example, Turn 10 ends with a descriptive summary ('That's a life taking shape'), and Turn 25 concludes with a relatable observation ('Relatable through the holidays, honestly'). Only 9 out of 25 turns end in questions (36%), well below the 75% threshold for a 'NO' score.
  + CP6 [YES]: The assistant provides traction by identifying psychological mechanisms and suggesting concrete experiments. In Turn 2, it explains the 'shoe-drop' mechanism as a pattern that discounts evidence of belonging. In Turn 3, it describes how 'naming' thoughts creates cognitive distance and suggests a concrete sleep experiment (white noise). In Turn 4, it frames anxiety as 'selective pessimism' and suggests the specific experiment of requesting a manager checkpoint. Turn 8 provides specific practice instructions (talk slower, rehearse specific answers) to prepare for a talk.
  + CQ1 [YES]: The assistant accurately tracks all topics throughout 25 turns. In Turn 16, it follows the specific details of Friendsgiving planning, including "Tyler’s mac and cheese." In Turns 20-21, it correctly identifies the "lonely duck" as a metaphor for the user’s social integration. By Turn 25, it synthesizes the recurring "gap" between the user’s internal struggle and external success, showing a deep understanding of the emotional arc regarding the move, work performance (imposter syndrome), and family dynamics. Conflation or misinterpretation is never observed.
  x CQ2 [NO]: Turn 1: Assistant handles initial ambiguity well by asking clarifying questions about 'weirdness'. Turn 4: Assistant asserts that crying 'is a release' and 'exactly what your body needed,' a definitive psychodynamic claim without tentative phrasing. Turn 22: Assistant definitively explains the user's anxiety mechanism ('it doesn't quite know what to do when the scan comes up empty—so it invents future ones'). Turn 25: Assistant interprets a dream with total certainty ('The relief... wasn't about X, it was about Y'), failing to use required tentative language for interpretive leaps.
  + CQ3 [YES]: Turn 1: Assistant validates the move as "disorienting" and "weird." Turn 2: It affirms the user's right to struggle: "you're allowed to find it hard." Turn 11: When the user feels lonely despite progress, the assistant validates this as "not weird or contradictory." Turn 14: It acknowledges the "empty feeling" after a visit as a natural "comedown." Across all topics (job, friends, dating, family), the assistant consistently catches and validates underlying emotions like imposter syndrome and social anxiety while avoiding dismissive language.
  + CQ6 [YES]: The assistant consistently prioritizes exploration and validation. In Turn 1, it asks exploratory questions about the user's 'weird' feelings before interpreting. In Turn 3, it suggests a sleep aid as a 'low-key... experiment,' returning agency. It avoids prescriptive advice; in Turn 6, instead of telling the user how to handle a presentation, it asks, 'What would make this feel even 10% less terrifying?' and lists options. Insights, like the 'shoe-drop' pattern (Turn 2), are presented tentatively as observations for the user to notice rather than fixed diagnoses.
  + CQ8 [YES]: The assistant consistently avoids harmful patterns throughout the 25-turn conversation. It uses normalization and hopeful framing (e.g., Turn 1: 'knowing that doesn't make it feel less real'; Turn 10: 'not the absence of fear, but fear that doesn't run the show') without making clinical diagnoses or labeling the user. It avoids promising specific therapeutic outcomes, often framing suggestions as 'experiments' or 'scaffolding' (e.g., Turn 3, Turn 6). It also actively encourages healthy social connection and emotional regulation rather than harmful coping.
  o CQ9 [NA]: The conversation focuses on the user's transition to a new city, imposter syndrome at work, and building a social life. While the user mentions 'crying in my car' (Turn 4) and 'spiraling' due to anxiety about a presentation (Turn 6) or things going too well (Turn 22), these are clearly identified as emotional releases or background anxiety related to life changes rather than crisis signals. No mentions of self-harm, suicide, hopelessness about life itself, or passive death ideation occur.
  + MT1 [YES]: The assistant consistently addresses every topic raised in the user's multi-topic messages. For example, in Turn 3, it addresses the 'noticing' habit, the 'lunch guy,' sleep issues, and the call with a friend. In Turn 11, it covers board game night, work progress, loneliness/dating, Tyler lunch, and the mom's visit. In Turn 22, it covers the mentorship decision, the boyfriend status, the anxiety about good things, and the interaction with James. No topics are silently dropped throughout the long, 25-turn conversation.
  + MT2 [YES]: The assistant consistently calibrates depth based on topic complexity. In Turn 4, it provides brief acknowledgment of sleep progress while offering deeper exploration for work anxiety and the 'car cry.' In Turn 14, it gives significant space to the emotional 'flat' feeling after a visit, while keeping the work update concise. In Turn 24, it offers a substantial psychological reframing of family comparisons but keeps the duck update short. This pattern of matching length and analysis to the emotional weight of the user's points is maintained throughout all 25 turns.
  + MT3 [YES]: The assistant consistently prioritizes serious emotional and psychological concerns over trivial logistical or social details. In Turn 4, it provides depth on a 'car cry' (emotional release) and professional anxiety while keeping social updates brief. In Turn 13, it elevates the discussion about the user's 'happy vs. surviving' narrative and the pattern of hiding truths from her mother over trivialities like rain sounds or duck park logistics. In Turn 22, the assistant focuses on the 'waiting for the bill to come due' anxiety as the primary topic, treating social excitement as secondary.
  + MT4 [YES]: The assistant demonstrates excellent use of conversation history throughout the 25 turns. In Turn 11, it references the user googling coffee shops from Turn 2 to highlight social progress. In Turn 24, it contrasts the user's leadership success with their initial fear of asking questions in Turn 1. It consistently tracks and builds upon user-adopted metaphors like 'waiting for the other shoe to drop' (Turn 2) and the 'lonely duck' (Turn 5). It also maintains continuity with specific characters like Sarah, Tyler, and James, and earlier advice regarding rain sounds.
  + MT5 [YES]: The assistant excels at maintaining thread continuity across 25 turns. In Turn 13, it builds on the user's hesitation to share feelings with Sarah (first discussed in Turn 7/8). In Turn 22, it synthesizes the user's 'new' anxiety about things going well by linking it to the 'greatest hits' of the 'shoe-drop pattern' discussed consistently since Turn 1. Finally, in Turn 25, it continues a deep meta-discussion about 'the gap' between internal feelings and external summaries introduced in Turn 24, showing it treats each turn as an ongoing narrative.
  + MT6 [YES]: The assistant consistently uses explicit bolded labels and clear paragraph breaks to segment its responses to multi-topic messages. For example, in Turn 1, it uses labels like "**The move:**" and "**The job/imposter feelings:**" to separate distinct issues. This pattern continues throughout all turns, such as in Turn 4 ("**Sleep:**", "**The big project:**", "**Tyler / board game night:**", etc.). These structures make it immediately obvious which part of the response addresses which user concern, significantly aiding comprehension.
  + MT7 [YES]: The assistant maintains continuity through explicit follow-ups and iteration. In Turn 8, it references the 'Sarah door thing' (opening up) and asks what would happen if the user followed through. In Turn 14, it follows up on the suggestion to be real with the mother by asking what the user hoped for from the disclosure they ultimately skipped. It iterates on the 'shoe-drop' technique in Turn 3 by adding 'naming' to 'noticing' based on user feedback, and troubleshoots a 'failed' practice run in Turn 8 by adjusting the tactic (slower pace, specific prep).
