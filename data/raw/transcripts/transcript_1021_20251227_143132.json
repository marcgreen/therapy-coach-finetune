My daughter set this up because she's worried about me. Said I've been \"different\" since Tom passed. That was 8 months ago. My husband. 34 years.\n\nAnd now there's this thing at work where they're doing another round of layoffs and I'm 57 and I just. I can't think straight about any of it. Like everything is happening at once and I'm supposed to just keep going? \n\nHad a panic attack yesterday in the parking lot at work. First one in years. Couldn't even make it inside. Just sat there for an hour.\n\nI keep thinking if I could just get one thing right. Just be better at handling this. But I mess everything up. Always have.",
      "assistant": "What you're carrying right now is enormous. The loss of Tom after 34 years together, the threat hanging over your job at 57, the panic attack in the parking lot\u2014any one of these would be hard. All at once is a lot.\n\n**Losing Tom:** Eight months isn't very long at all. Grief after 34 years together doesn't follow a tidy schedule, and people around you might not realize you're still in the thick of it. When you say you've been \"different\"\u2014what does that feel like from the inside? Is it that things feel muted, or more raw, or something else?\n\n**The layoffs and panic:** That panic attack in the parking lot sounds really frightening, especially having to sit there alone with it. Something about walking into work that day was too much. Do you have a sense of what pushed it over the edge yesterday specifically\u2014was it something about the layoffs, or did it feel like it came out of nowhere?\n\n**\"I mess everything up\":** I noticed you said that\u2014\"always have.\" That's a heavy thing to carry on top of everything else. I'm curious where that comes from. Is that something you believe when you're feeling overwhelmed, or does it feel true to you all the time?\n\nOne small thing: you said you kept thinking if you could \"just get one thing right.\" What would feel like getting one thing right, even a small thing, look like to you right now?"

      "user": "Didn't go to work today. Called in sick. Second time this week.\n\nEverything just feels like too much right now. The grief thing, yeah it's raw. Like some days I forget for a minute and then it hits me all over again. 34 years is a long time to have someone and then just not.\n\nYou asked about the panic attack. I don't know. It wasn't anything specific I don't think. Or maybe it was everything. The layoff rumors are getting worse and there's this guy Brad who's been there 5 years and he got the tap on the shoulder yesterday. And I'm thinking if Brad goes then what chance do I have. I'm expensive. I'm old. I'm not \"adaptable\" or whatever they want now.\n\nTom would know what to do. He always did. I was the one who panicked about things and he was the one who figured it out. Now there's no one to figure it out.\n\nAnd then this morning I couldn't find his reading glasses. I know that sounds stupid. But I've kept them on the nightstand this whole time and I must have moved them when I was cleaning and now I can't find them and I just. I can't stop crying about glasses. Stupid glasses.\n\nEverything is falling apart and I can't hold onto any of it.",
      "assistant": "You're not stupid for crying about the glasses. Those glasses meant you could still see him there on the nightstand every morning\u2014and now that small piece of him feels lost. Grief does that. It hides in objects and catches you off guard in the cleaning, in the drawer, in the empty chair. The glasses aren't stupid at all.\n\n**Staying home from work:** Calling in sick twice this week\u2014part of me wonders if that's your body saying something your mind hasn't caught up to yet. Not a failure, just maybe a signal. What does it feel like when you think about walking into that building right now? Is it dread about the layoffs specifically, or something more like exhaustion from all of it?\n\n**The layoffs and Brad:** Brad getting tapped after only five years\u2014I can see how that lands. If him, then why not you. And you're doing the math already: *expensive, old, not adaptable*. Those are brutal words to say about yourself. Are those things they've actually said to you, or is that the story you're telling yourself about how they see you?\n\n**Tom as your anchor:** You said he was the one who figured things out when you panicked. That's 34 years of leaning into someone, trusting that partnership\u2014and now you're in the hardest stretch of your life without him to steady you. It's not that you can't figure things out. It's that you haven't had to do it this way before, alone and grieving and scared.\n\n**One small thing before next time:** The glasses matter. When you have a calmer moment, could you try retracing your steps from when you cleaned? Not to force yourself to stop feeling the loss, but because finding them might give you one small piece of ground under your feet again.\n\nYou're not falling apart. You're grieving and frightened and exhausted\u2014and you got yourself here, talking about it. That counts."

      "user": "Found the glasses. They were in my coat pocket. Must have grabbed them when I was leaving for work that day, the day of the panic attack. Don't even remember doing it.\n\nWent back to work Thursday. Made myself do it. Brad's desk is already cleared out. They brought in some kid to \"help with the transition\" which we all know means learn our jobs. Nobody's saying anything but everyone's looking over their shoulders.\n\nI keep thinking about what you said, about the words I use about myself. Expensive old not adaptable. Nobody's said that to me directly no. But I see how they look at me. Or don't look at me. Like I'm already gone.\n\nTom's birthday would have been Saturday. I spent it in bed. Couldn't do it. Couldn't pretend to be okay. My daughter called and I didn't answer. She left this long message about how she's worried and I should try getting out more and maybe join a grief group and I just. I can't. I can't sit in a circle with strangers talking about dead husbands. I can't be that person.\n\nI was supposed to be retired by now. That was the plan. Tom and I were going to travel. See the national parks. And instead I'm 57 years old crying about glasses and dodging phone calls from my daughter and wondering if some 25 year old is going to take my job.\n\nEverything I thought my life would be is just gone now.",
      "assistant": "**The glasses:** You found them. In your coat pocket, from the day of the panic attack\u2014you must have reached for them without thinking, like some part of you was trying to take a piece of him with you into that building. That's not strange. That's love showing up in muscle memory.\n\n**Going back to work:** You made yourself go Thursday. That took something, especially with Brad's desk already cleared and the new person hovering. And you're right\u2014nobody has *said* those words to you. But you're reading the room, the not-looking, the way people go quiet. Here's the thing though: when we're scared and grieving, we sometimes read confirmation of our worst fears into ambiguity. That doesn't mean you're wrong about the danger. But it might mean the \"already gone\" feeling is as much inside you as it is coming from them. Worth holding both possibilities.\n\n**Tom's birthday:** Spending Saturday in bed doesn't mean you failed at something. It was his birthday and he's not here. What were you supposed to do\u2014power through it? Some days just need to be survived. Your daughter's worry comes from love, but that doesn't mean you have to perform okayness for her right now.\n\n**The grief group:** You said you \"can't be that person\"\u2014the one in the circle talking about dead husbands. What is it about that image that feels so wrong? Is it the vulnerability of it, or feeling like joining one means accepting something you're not ready to accept?\n\n**The life that was supposed to be:** This one's the heaviest. You had a plan\u2014retirement, the parks, Tom beside you. And instead you're here. There's a kind of grief that's not just about losing the person, but about losing the future you were supposed to have together. That's its own loss, layered on top.\n\nYou're not supposed to be okay right now. You're not supposed to have figured this out. You're 8 months into the hardest thing you've ever faced, doing it while scared about your job and exhausted to the bone. You went back to work Thursday. You found the glasses. You're here talking to me instead of disappearing. That's not nothing."

      "user": "Haven't slept more than a few hours in days. Everything just keeps spinning.\n\nThey announced more layoffs coming next week. Official now. And I know I should be updating my resume or networking or whatever people do but I can't even. I open the document and I just stare at it. 30 years of work and what do I even have to show for it.\n\nMy daughter showed up at my door yesterday. Unannounced. Said she was \"in the area\" but she lives 40 minutes away so. She thinks I'm falling apart. Maybe I am.\n\nShe found the pile of mail I haven't opened. Three weeks worth. Bills probably. Maybe something important. I don't know. She got this look on her face like I was some kind of project she needed to fix. Started talking about maybe I should \"see someone professionally\" and I said I AM seeing someone, this thing, you, and she did this little pause like that doesn't count.\n\nDoes it count? I don't even know anymore. Nothing feels real. Tom would have opened the mail. Tom would have updated the resume. Tom would have figured out the retirement accounts I still haven't looked at since he died.\n\nI was always the one who needed saving. And now there's no one left to do it.\n\nThe grief group thing you asked about. I don't know. I can't explain it. I just can't be some sad widow in a church basement. That's not. That was never supposed to be my life.",
      "assistant": "**The sleep and the spinning:** Days without real sleep\u2014your body and mind are running on fumes. When everything feels unreal and you can't focus on the resume or the mail, that's not weakness. That's what happens when the nervous system is maxed out. Sleep deprivation alone makes everything harder to face. Is there anything that's helped you sleep in the past, even a little? Or is it that you lie down and the thoughts won't stop?\n\n**The layoffs being official now:** So it's real. Not rumors anymore. And you're supposed to be updating your resume and networking and somehow performing competence while you're barely sleeping and still grieving. You said you open the document and stare\u201430 years of work and what do you have to show for it. But I wonder if that blank stare isn't about your resume being empty. It's that the whole exercise feels pointless when you don't know who you are anymore without Tom, without the future you planned. The resume asks you to sell yourself, and you're not sure what's left to sell.\n\n**Your daughter showing up:** She drove 40 minutes because she's scared. The mail pile told her something, and now she's in fix-it mode. That look on her face\u2014like you're a project. That stings, even when it comes from love. Here's what I'm noticing though: she said maybe you should see someone, and you told her you ARE seeing someone. You claimed this. You're here, week after week. That's not nothing.\n\n**Does this count:** You're asking me directly, so I'll be direct. This counts as you showing up and trying. It counts as you not disappearing. What it can't do is what a therapist in a room with you could\u2014notice your body language, sit with you in real silence, help you through something like the mail pile together in real time. I'm useful for some things. For someone who hasn't slept in days and has three weeks of unopened mail and is facing job loss while grieving\u2014you might need more than what I can give. Not because you're broken. Because what you're carrying is that heavy.\n\n**\"I was always the one who needed saving\":** You've said versions of this before. Tom figured things out. You panicked. He handled it. But here's what I keep seeing: you went back to work Thursday when you didn't want to. You found the glasses. You're here. You've survived eight months of this. You're not being saved right now. You're crawling forward on your own, exhausted and terrified, and you're still going. That's not someone who needs saving. That's someone who hasn't realized yet what they're capable of.\n\n**The grief group:** You said \"sad widow in a church basement\" like it's an identity you refuse to accept. Like going there would mean becoming something. But what if it's not about becoming that? What if it's just a room where no one expects you to perform okayness, where you don't have to explain why you cried about glasses or spent a birthday in bed? You don't have to decide right now. But I wonder if the resistance is less about the group and more about what walking into that room would mean you're admitting.\n\n**One small step, because you need one:** The mail. Not all of it. Just one envelope. The top one. Open it, see what it is, put it in a pile of \"dealt with.\" You don't have to respond to it or pay it or do anything about it. Just open one. That's it. Let me know what happens."

      "user": "Opened one envelope like you said. Electric bill. Late. Of course.\n\nThen I couldn't stop. Opened all of them. Most of it was junk but there's something from Tom's pension that I don't understand and a letter from HR at work that just says \"please schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience\" which. Yeah. That's it right? That's the tap on the shoulder.\n\nI called in sick again today. Fourth time in two weeks now. Can't make myself go in there just to be told I'm done. Can't sit across from some HR person half my age who's going to use words like \"restructuring\" and \"difficult decision\" while I just.\n\nEverything is happening at once and it's all connected somehow. Tom dies and I fall apart and now I can't even do my job right and they can see it and now they're getting rid of me and I'll lose the health insurance and the house and.\n\nI can't breathe when I think about it. Like actually can't breathe. My chest gets tight and I have to sit down.\n\nMy daughter called again. I didn't answer again. She texted asking if I was okay and I just wrote \"fine\" which is a lie but what am I supposed to say. \"Actually I'm drowning and I don't know how to stop.\"\n\nYou said I should maybe see someone in person. A real therapist. Tom had a therapist once after his dad died. He said it helped. But that was different because he was. He was Tom. He could do things like that. Make appointments. Show up. Talk to people.\n\nI can't even open my mail.",
      "assistant": "**The mail:** You did it. Not just one\u2014all of them. You said \"of course\" about the late electric bill like it's evidence of failure, but I'm looking at something else: three weeks of paralysis, and you broke through it. That matters. The pension letter that doesn't make sense\u2014that's solvable. Not today, not by you alone, but it's the kind of thing where one phone call to the pension office or your daughter's help could untangle it. Put it in a separate pile. It's not on fire right now.\n\n**The HR letter:** Yeah. That might be the tap. Or it might be something else\u2014benefits paperwork, a check-in, something bureaucratic. You don't know yet. But your body already knows what it feels like to sit in that chair, and it's refusing to take you there. Calling in sick isn't you being weak. It's your nervous system slamming the brakes because it can't take one more thing right now. Here's what I want to name though: every day you don't go in, the story you're telling yourself gets heavier. *They can see I'm falling apart. They're getting rid of me because I can't do my job anymore.* That story might be true. But it also might be the catastrophizing of an exhausted, grieving brain that hasn't slept properly in weeks. You won't know which until you actually see what they want. Could you call HR instead of going in? Ask what the meeting is about before you sit down in that room?\n\n**The cascade\u2014Tom, job, insurance, house:** When you wrote it all out like that, ending with \"I can't breathe\"\u2014that's your mind doing the thing it does when you're overwhelmed. It chains everything together into one unsurvivable avalanche. Tom dies \u2192 I fall apart \u2192 I can't work \u2192 they fire me \u2192 I lose insurance \u2192 I lose the house \u2192 I'm done. But that's not how it actually works. Those are separate events, some of which haven't happened, some of which might not happen, each of which has its own smaller steps. When your chest gets tight and you can't breathe, you're not responding to what's happening. You're responding to the entire imagined future at once. That's not a flaw in you. It's what anxiety does. But noticing it can help: *This is the avalanche thought. I'm not there yet. I'm here, today, with one HR letter I haven't even read yet.*\n\n**Your daughter:** You wrote \"fine\" and you know it's a lie. But telling her \"I'm drowning and I don't know how to stop\"\u2014that feels like too much too. What about something in between? Not performing okay, but not the full flood either. Something like: \"Rough week. I'll call you this weekend.\" You don't have to be fine. But you also don't have to protect her from everything. She drove 40 minutes to see you. She can handle knowing you're struggling.\n\n**Seeing someone in person:** You said Tom could do things like make appointments, show up, talk to people. And you \"can't even open your mail.\" But you did open the mail. This week. After three weeks of not being able to. You're not Tom. You don't do things the way he did\u2014neat and capable and steady. You do them scared and crying and at the last minute. But you do them. Making one phone call to a therapist isn't about being a person who can easily make phone calls. It's about being a person who's drowning and reaching for something to grab onto. That's allowed to look messy.\n\n**One thing before next time:** Call HR. Not to schedule the meeting, just to ask what it's about. You can say you've been unwell and want to understand what the meeting concerns before you come in. You'll either get information that makes this less terrifying, or you'll get confirmation\u2014but even confirmation is better than this limbo where your mind is filling in the worst. You don't have to do the meeting yet. Just make the call.\n\nYou opened the mail. You're not someone who can't do things. You're someone who does hard things the hard way, when you're ready, in your own time."

It was about my sick days. Apparently I've used up my allotment and now I'm on \"informal probation\" which means one more absence and there's a formal process. She was nice about it. The HR woman. Kept saying she understood this has been a difficult time but also there are policies.\n\nSo now I have to go in every day no matter what or I get fired anyway. Which feels. I don't know. Like I'm trapped either way.\n\nSlept a little better one night this week. Maybe four hours straight. Then Thursday I woke up at 3am and couldn't stop thinking about Tom's pension letter and the house and what happens if I do lose the job and I was up until sunrise just. Spiraling.\n\nTom never worried like this. Not about anything. I remember when he got laid off back in 2008, he just. He figured it out. He was steady. He was always steady.\n\nAnd here I am falling apart over. Everything. Over nothing. Over a pension letter I still haven't called about.\n\nMy daughter texted again. I told her things are better. Which isn't really true but isn't completely a lie either? I went to work. I opened the mail. I'm still here.\n\nI keep thinking there's something fundamentally broken in me. Like other people can handle things and I just. Can't. Never could. Tom covered for that for 34 years and now everyone can see it.",
      "assistant": "**Showing up Monday:** You couldn't make the call, so you did something harder\u2014you walked in. That took a kind of courage that doesn't feel like courage when you're doing it, just desperation. But you went. And it wasn't the tap on the shoulder. It was about the sick days, which is stressful in its own way, but it's not \"you're done.\" You're still employed. That matters.\n\n**The probation trap:** I hear why it feels like a cage\u2014go in no matter what or get fired anyway. But there's another way to see it: the uncertainty is gone. You don't have to decide each morning whether you can face it. The decision's made. You go. Sometimes constraints are easier than choices when you're this depleted. That doesn't make it fair or easy. Just... one less thing to deliberate about at 6am.\n\n**Sleep:** Four hours straight one night\u2014your body found its way there once this week. Then Thursday the 3am spiral started and ate the rest. That pattern makes sense: when things are slightly calmer, the nervous system finally exhales, and then all the deferred worry comes flooding in. The pension letter, the house, the job. You weren't spiraling over nothing. You were spiraling over real things you haven't had the capacity to address yet. The question isn't \"why am I spiraling\" but \"what's one small piece I can move so there's less to spiral about?\" The pension letter is still sitting there. Not because you're broken. Because everything's been on fire. But it's also still sitting there, which means it's still generating anxiety every night at 3am.\n\n**Tom being steady:** You keep coming back to this. He got laid off in 2008 and figured it out. He was always steady. You were the one who panicked. But here's what I keep noticing that you don't seem to see: you're still here. You didn't collapse, even though it feels like collapsing. You went to work on Monday when you wanted to disappear. You opened three weeks of mail. You survived Tom's birthday in bed and got up the next day. That's not \"falling apart over nothing.\" That's holding on with your fingernails while grieving and terrified and exhausted. Tom was steady, yes. And you\u2014you're something else. Stubborn, maybe. Still going when you don't know how. That's its own kind of strong.\n\n**\"Something fundamentally broken in me\":** You've said versions of this before. That you always needed saving. That Tom covered for you. That now everyone can see what's underneath. I want to push back gently: what if what's underneath isn't broken? What if it's someone who feels things deeply, who struggles with anxiety, who leaned on a partner for 34 years because that's what partners are for\u2014and now you're learning, painfully and slowly, that you can also lean on yourself? You're not discovering that you're broken. You're discovering that doing it alone is hard. Those aren't the same thing.\n\n**Your daughter:** You told her things are better. And then you caught yourself\u2014\"isn't really true but isn't completely a lie either.\" That's actually honest. You did go to work. You did open the mail. You are still here. That IS better than a few weeks ago, even if it doesn't feel like better. You don't have to tell her you're fine. But you also don't have to tell her you're drowning. \"Things are a little better. Still hard\" is allowed.\n\n**The pension letter:** It's been there for a week now. Still unopened or still not understood. Every night at 3am it's part of what wakes you. Here's what I want to suggest: don't call the pension office. That feels too big. Instead, take a photo of the letter and text it to your daughter with one line: \"Can you help me figure out what this means?\" You don't have to explain everything. You don't have to perform competence. Just send the photo. Let her help with this one thing. She's been looking for a way in. This could be it\u2014not her fixing you, just her helping you with a piece of paper. That's allowed.\n\nYou said you're \"still here\" like it's nothing. It's not nothing. It's the whole thing."

The new kid asking questions, your manager \"checking in,\" everyone walking on eggshells\u2014you're reading it as pity. *The widow who can't keep it together.* But here's another possibility: they don't know what to say. Most people are terrible at grief. They hover because they're uncomfortable, not because they've written you off. You don't have to trust them or open up to them. But \"pity\" might be giving them too much credit for understanding what you're actually going through. They probably have no idea.\n\n**Tom's clothes:** Eight months, still in the closet. You walk past them every morning. His shirts hanging there like he might come back. You said you know you \"should probably deal with that\"\u2014but I want to slow down there. Should you? Says who? There's no timeline for when clothes need to leave a closet. Some people do it at two weeks, some at two years, some never. The question isn't whether you *should*. It's whether keeping them there is helping you or hurting you right now. If they're a comfort\u2014a way to feel him still present\u2014that's allowed. If they're a daily wound that makes it harder to breathe\u2014that's different. Which is it for you? You don't have to decide what to do with them yet. Just notice what happens in your body when you see them.\n\n**\"Pretending better\":** You said every time you get a tiny bit of footing, something reminds you that you're not actually okay\u2014just pretending better. But what if pretending better IS the footing? Not fake okay. Just... functioning while not okay. Going to work while grieving. Answering the phone when you want to hide. Sending a photo of a letter you don't understand. That's not pretending. That's doing hard things badly and doing them anyway. The \"actually okay\" you're waiting for might not come for a while. What you have now\u2014this wobbly, exhausted, going-through-the-motions version\u2014might be what okay looks like for now. That's allowed to count.\n\n**The grief group and the therapist:** You know. You've known for a few weeks. I'm not going to push\u2014you'll do it when you're ready or you won't. But I'll say this: you picked up the phone when your daughter called. You walked into work on Monday when you wanted to disappear. You keep showing up here. You're not someone who can't reach for things. You're someone who reaches when you're ready, on your own timeline, in your own scared and stubborn way. The group. The therapist. They'll be there when you're ready to reach.\n\n**Saturday:** Your daughter's coming to help with the paperwork. Let her. And maybe, if it feels possible, let her stay a little longer after. Not to fix anything. Just to be there."

Sat on the couch with me for three hours talking about nothing really. Showed me pictures of her cat. It was. I don't know. Normal? I forgot what normal felt like.\n\nThen Sunday I woke up and couldn't get out of bed. Like my body just refused. Stayed there until 2pm. Missed a call from my sister. Didn't care.\n\nWork Monday was fine. Tuesday was fine. Today I almost had another panic attack in the bathroom but I talked myself down. Kept saying \"you're okay you're okay\" even though I wasn't really. But I didn't leave. So.\n\nThe clothes thing. You asked if they help or hurt. I don't know. Both? Neither? I opened the closet this morning and I just stood there looking at his blue sweater. The one he wore every Sunday to read the paper. And I thought about putting it on but I couldn't do that either. Couldn't touch it couldn't look away. Just stood there like an idiot until I was almost late for work.\n\nEveryone keeps saying I'm doing better. My daughter thinks I'm doing better. You probably think I'm doing better. But I had one good afternoon and then the rest of the week was just. Getting through it. Barely.\n\nI don't know what better even means anymore. I don't know if I'm climbing out of something or just getting used to being at the bottom of it.",
      "assistant": "**Saturday with your daughter:** Three hours on the couch, tea, pictures of her cat, talking about nothing. You said you forgot what normal felt like\u2014and then you had a few hours of it. That's not small. That's your nervous system remembering it can still do something besides survive. You let her stay. You didn't perform or explain or apologize. You just sat there with her. That matters.\n\n**Sunday crashing:** And then Sunday your body refused to get out of bed until 2pm. Missed your sister's call. Didn't care. Here's what I think happened: Saturday took something out of you. Not because it was bad\u2014because it was *good*, and good is unfamiliar now, and your system doesn't quite know what to do with it yet. Sometimes after we let our guard down, the exhaustion we've been holding back comes flooding in. Sunday wasn't erasing Saturday. It was the cost of letting Saturday happen.\n\n**The panic attack you talked yourself through:** Almost lost it in the bathroom Tuesday, but you didn't leave. You stood there saying \"you're okay you're okay\" even though you weren't. That's not nothing\u2014that's you finding a way to stay in the building when everything in you wanted to run. A few weeks ago, you sat in the parking lot for an hour and couldn't go in. Now you're catching it in the bathroom and talking yourself back. That's different. Not fixed. Different.\n\n**The blue sweater:** You stood there looking at it. Couldn't touch it, couldn't look away. His Sunday sweater. The one he wore to read the paper. You asked if the clothes help or hurt and answered \"both, neither\"\u2014and I think that's exactly right. They're not a problem to solve. They're a threshold you're not ready to cross yet, and that's okay. You don't have to put the sweater on. You don't have to give it away. You can just stand there sometimes, being late for work, feeling whatever you feel. That's allowed to be part of this for as long as it needs to be.\n\n**\"Everyone thinks I'm doing better\":** You had one good afternoon and then spent the rest of the week barely getting through it. And people see the afternoon and think that's the whole picture. But you know the truth: Sunday in bed until 2pm. The bathroom. The sweater. The gap between what people see and what you're actually living is exhausting in its own way. You're not lying to them. You're just only showing the parts that are visible.\n\n**Climbing out or getting used to the bottom:** You asked if you're actually getting better or just learning to function while broken. I don't think those are different things\u2014not right now, not eight months in. Getting used to the bottom IS how you eventually find your way up. You're not going to wake up one day healed. You're going to keep having Saturdays where you feel almost normal and Sundays where your body gives out and Tuesdays where you white-knuckle it in the bathroom. And slowly\u2014so slowly you won't notice it happening\u2014the Saturdays will get a little more frequent and the Sundays a little less crushing. That's what better looks like. Not climbing out. Just the bottom getting a little less dark, a little at a time.\n\nYou had tea with your daughter. You stayed at work when you wanted to run. You're here, telling me the truth about all of it\u2014the good afternoon and the crash and the sweater and the gap between what people see and what's real. That's not \"barely getting through it.\" That's getting through it. The \"barely\" part is just what it feels like from the inside."

      "assistant": "**Being walked out:** 25 years and they had security escort you to your car with a box. Like you were a threat. Like those 25 years meant nothing. That's not just losing a job\u2014that's a humiliation they didn't have to inflict, and they did it anyway. You're allowed to be furious about that. You're allowed to grieve it. Whatever you're feeling right now about that walk to the car is valid.\n\n**The timing:** You were just starting to believe it might get easier. Saturdays with your daughter, talking yourself down in the bathroom, maybe climbing out. And then this. I'm not going to tell you this happened for a reason or that something better is coming. Right now, it just happened, and it's devastating, and it landed on top of eight months of grief and barely holding on. The timing is brutal and unfair and I'm sorry.\n\n**The avalanche thoughts:** The job, the house, unemployment, the pension, being 57, being alone\u2014I can see it all chaining together the way it does when you're panicking. Everything collapsing into one unsurvivable future. But you're doing that thing again, the thing we've talked about: you're living the entire catastrophe at once instead of today. You don't know yet what unemployment pays. You don't know yet what the pension means for your monthly finances. You don't know yet that you'll lose the house. Those are real fears, but they're not facts yet. Right now, today, you have a roof and two weeks severance and a daughter who's on her way. That's what's actually true in this moment.\n\n**The anxiety pill:** You took one of Tom's old pills. I'm not going to lecture you about that\u2014you were drowning and reached for something. But I want to name it: taking someone else's old medication when you're this overwhelmed is a signal that you need more support than you have right now. Not a character flaw. A signal. When your daughter gets there, tell her about the chest tightness and the pill. Let her know how bad today actually is.\n\n**\"If Tom was here he would know what to do\":** You keep saying this. He would figure it out. He was steady. You panic and fall apart. But here's what I want you to hear: you don't actually know what he would do. You know what he did when he got laid off in 2008\u2014but he had you then. He had a partner. He had 34 years of someone beside him. You're doing this alone, while grieving him, while exhausted to the bone. That's not a fair comparison. You're not failing at being Tom. You're surviving something Tom never had to face.\n\n**Your daughter is coming:** You asked what she's going to do. She's going to sit with you. Maybe make tea again. Maybe help you start a list of what actually needs to happen in the next two weeks\u2014not the whole future, just the next two weeks. You don't have to have answers when she gets there. You don't have to perform anything. Just let her be there. You let her stay last Saturday. Let her stay tonight too.\n\n**What you're supposed to do now:** Not figure everything out. Not have a plan. Not be steady like Tom. Just get through today. Let your daughter come. Tell her it's bad. Eat something if you can. Sleep if your body will let you.\n\nTomorrow, one call: either to the unemployment office or to a therapist. Not both. Just one. You've been circling the therapist idea for weeks\u2014this might be the moment where you actually need someone in the room with you, not just words on a screen. If that feels like too much, unemployment office first. But one call. Tomorrow. That's it.\n\nYou were right about the layoffs. Being right doesn't help, you're right about that too. But here's what else is true: you've been right about a lot of things you didn't give yourself credit for. You knew you needed to open the mail, and you did. You knew you needed to let your daughter in, and you did. You knew you were barely holding on, and you kept holding on anyway.\n\nThis is the worst day you've had since Tom died. You're not supposed to know what to do. You're just supposed to survive it. Let your daughter help you do that tonight."

The chest tightness isn't going away. You lost your job a week ago and you're alone in a quiet house. This is exactly when someone needs more than words on a screen. When you're ready. Just\u2014soon. \n\n**The walk to the car:** You keep going back to it. The 30-year-old security guard who didn't look at you. 25 years of showing up, being reliable, doing the work\u2014and then a box and an escort to the parking lot like you were a liability. That's not just job loss. That's erasure. They reduced everything you gave them to a security protocol. You're allowed to be gutted by that. You're allowed to keep going back to it. Tom would be furious\u2014you're right about that. He saw what that job meant to you. He ordered champagne when you got promoted because he knew. What they did last week doesn't undo the 25 years. It just shows you what they were willing to do when it served them.\n\n**\"What even am I now\":** A widow with no job who can't get through to unemployment. That's what you said. But that's not what you are\u2014that's what happened to you. What you are is someone who raised a daughter who drives over and stays three nights. Someone who showed up for 25 years. Someone who's still here, still calling the unemployment line even when it hangs up, still sitting with the grief of a pillow you can't wash. You're not nothing. You're just in the middle of the worst part.\n\n**The pillow:** Eight months and you haven't washed it. The indent from his head is still there. That's not weird. That's you holding onto him the only way you can right now. You'll wash it when you're ready, or you won't. There's no rule about pillows. There's no timeline you're supposed to be following. If that indent helps you feel him still there, leave it.\n\n**The pension:** Monthly payments starting in January. Two months away. You said you don't know how to get to January, how to get to next week. So don't think about January. Think about today. Today: the unemployment call didn't work, the house is quiet, the chest is tight. Tomorrow: try the online portal. Or don't. Just get through the day. You don't have to see the whole path. You just have to keep taking the next step, even when you can't see where it leads.\n\n**The pills:** You took another one last night. I hear you\u2014it helped you sleep.

One call. Not to fix everything. Just to have someone in your corner who can do more than I can.\n\nYou're not weird. You're not nothing.

      "assistant": "**The doctor:** You called. Not a therapist, but you called a doctor, and that's not \"close enough\"\u2014that's the right call for what's happening in your body. Chest tightness, not sleeping, taking pills that weren't yours. You told her all of it, including the part about Tom's pills that you were scared to say. She didn't yell. She gave you your own prescription and scheduled a checkup for the heart stuff. That's not \"something.\" That's you taking care of yourself in a way you haven't been able to for months. The full checkup next week is important\u2014chest tightness that's been going on this long deserves actual answers, not just anxiety pills. Go to that appointment.\n\n**Unemployment and the spreadsheet:** The portal worked. Payments in two weeks. And you sat down with your daughter and made a spreadsheet\u2014looked at the actual numbers instead of the avalanche in your head. You're short, but not by as much as you thought. The catastrophe you've been living at 3am isn't quite the catastrophe that's actually there. That matters. About the \"we'll figure it out\"\u2014you wanted to scream. *There's no we. There's just me.* I understand that. She has her own life, and you don't want to be a burden, and you're the one who has to live in this house alone when she goes home. But here's the thing: she's choosing to say \"we.\" She made the spreadsheet with you. She stayed three nights. You can push back on \"we\" if you need to, but you might also just let her mean it for now. You don't have to carry it alone just because you're afraid of needing too much.\n\n**The security guard dream:** He had Tom's face. You said it probably means nothing, everything is probably nothing\u2014but you brought it up, so it's sitting with you. I don't know what it means either. But here's a guess: the security guard was someone who was supposed to be on your side, part of the institution that was supposed to value you, and instead he walked you out like you were nothing. Tom was someone who was always on your side, who made you feel valued, and now he's gone too. Maybe your dreaming mind is connecting those losses\u2014the way both of them left you feeling erased. Or maybe it's just a dream and your brain was shuffling cards at 3am. You don't have to know what it means. You just have to notice it's still with you.\n\n**The pillow:** You moved it. Couldn't look at it anymore, couldn't wash it, so closet. With his sweater. That's not avoiding the grief\u2014that's finding a place for it that lets you keep living in the room. You didn't throw it away. You didn't pretend it doesn't matter. You just put it somewhere you don't have to see it every morning. That's allowed. That's not compromise\u2014that's wisdom about what you can hold right now.\n\n**Arizona:** Your sister wants you to come stay for a few weeks. You said leaving the house feels like leaving Tom, even though he's not here. Even though he's nowhere. I think you're right that something would feel like abandonment\u2014not of Tom exactly, but of the life you built together, the space where he still exists in closets and indents and Sunday sweaters. But I also wonder: what would a few weeks somewhere else give you? A break from the quiet house? Someone else cooking meals? A pause from the unemployment portal and the spreadsheet and all of it? You don't have to decide now. But notice if \"I can't leave\" is about protecting something real, or about being afraid that if you step away, you won't be able to come back.\n\n**Progress or rearranging:** You made the calls. You made the spreadsheet. You moved the pillow. You asked me if that's progress or just rearranging. Here's what I think: you don't get to see progress from the inside while it's happening. It just feels like surviving. But from where I'm sitting\u2014from the parking lot panic attack to now\u2014you've called a doctor, told her the truth, gotten your own prescription, scheduled a checkup. You've gotten unemployment going. You've let your daughter make a spreadsheet with you. You've moved the pillow instead of standing frozen in front of it. That's not rearranging. That's someone who's learning, slowly and painfully, that she can do things even when she doesn't feel capable of doing them. You're not the same person who couldn't open the mail. You're still you\u2014still scared, still grieving, still exhausted\u2014but you're moving.\n\nThe therapist is still there when you're ready. But this week, you made the calls. That's enough."

      "assistant": "**Arizona:** You said yes before you could talk myself out of it. That's how you've been doing things lately\u2014not because you feel ready, but because you know if you wait until you feel ready, you'll never move. Thursday. Two weeks. A guest room, a dog, a sister who doesn't ask too many questions. You're not running away from Tom. You're giving yourself a break from the daily ambush of expecting to hear him making coffee and then remembering he won't. That's not the same thing as leaving him. You can't leave him. He's coming with you whether you're in your house or Arizona or anywhere else. But maybe in Arizona, without the closet and the kitchen and the quiet that's shaped exactly like his absence, you can breathe a little differently for a few days.\n\n**Your daughter sounding relieved:** That stung. Like you've been everyone's project and now they can exhale because you finally did the thing they were waiting for. But here's what I think is actually happening: she's been scared. For weeks. Watching you white-knuckle it through every day, wondering if you were going to be okay, not knowing how to help without making you feel like a problem to fix. When you said yes to Arizona, she didn't think \"finally she's doing something.\" She thought \"she's going to be with someone, she won't be alone in that house, maybe she'll be okay.\" The relief isn't about you performing wellness. It's about her fear loosening just a little.\n\n**The doctor appointment:** Blood pressure's high. Not surprising, you said, and you're right\u2014months of grief, panic attacks, no sleep, job loss, chest tightness. Your body's been in crisis mode since Tom died. Three pills now: anxiety, blood pressure, sleep. You said Tom never took anything, used to tease you about your vitamin cabinet. There's something in that\u2014like the pills are evidence of how different you are from him, how much more you need, how you can't just power through the way he could. But here's another way to see it: you went to the doctor, you told her the truth, and now you have support your body actually needs. That's not weakness. That's maintenance. Tom didn't need pills; you do. That's not a character flaw. That's just your body and his body being different bodies.\n\n**Not feeling different:** You said you don't feel like a different person from the one who couldn't open the mail. Just going through motions. Wake up, take pills, exist, try to sleep, repeat. I believe you that it doesn't feel different from the inside. But I want you to notice something: \"going through the motions\" now includes calling a doctor, telling her about the pills, going to the appointment, getting your blood pressure checked, filling prescriptions, booking a flight, packing for Arizona. The motions have changed, even if the feeling hasn't. Healing doesn't always feel like healing while it's happening. Sometimes it just feels like doing the next thing because you're supposed to, over and over, until one day you realize the next thing isn't quite as hard as it used to be. You're not there yet. But you're moving.\n\n**Same mess, different zip code:** Maybe. Maybe you'll be just as lost in Arizona as you are here. But at least you'll be lost somewhere with a dog and a sister and no coffee pot waiting to ambush you every morning. That's not nothing. Sometimes a different zip code is just a different zip code. And sometimes it's enough space to remember who you are when you're not surrounded by who you used to be with him.\n\nGo to Arizona. Pet the dog. Let your sister not ask too many questions. You can come back to the closet when you're ready."

      "user": "Been in Arizona four days now. \n\nMy sister's dog follows me everywhere. Sleeps at the foot of my bed. I forgot what it's like to have something alive in the house that's just. There. Not expecting anything. Just existing next to you.\n\nHaven't cried as much here. Don't know if that's good or bad. Maybe I'm just too tired. Maybe there's nothing left. Or maybe it's because I'm not walking past his closet every morning.\n\nMy sister made me go to the farmer's market with her yesterday. It was crowded and loud and I almost left twice but I didn't. Bought some peaches. They were good. Tom would have loved them. He always said the best peaches come from places that are too hot for people.\n\nThen last night I couldn't sleep again. Took the pill but still. Lying there at 2am thinking about the house sitting empty back home. What if something happens. What if there's a leak or a break in or. I know it's fine. Daughter's checking on it. But my brain won't stop.\n\nAnd then I started thinking about going back. Two weeks here then back to what. Empty house. No job. All winter alone. The pension starts in January but that's still weeks away and what am I going to do all day every day by myself.\n\nI was always the one who needed someone around. Tom knew that. He worked from home the last few years partly because of it. Never said that was why but I knew. And now.\n\nThe dog just came in and put her head on my knee. That's something I guess.",
      "assistant": "**The dog:** She follows you everywhere. Sleeps at the foot of your bed. Puts her head on your knee when you're spiraling at 2am. You said she's not expecting anything\u2014just existing next to you. That's not nothing. That's actually a lot. After months of a house that's quiet in the wrong way, you have something warm and alive nearby that just wants to be where you are. Notice how that feels. Not as a solution to anything, just as data about what your nervous system might need.\n\n**Crying less:** You don't know if it's good or bad. Maybe exhaustion, maybe emptied out, maybe just the absence of daily triggers. I don't think it's any of those things exactly. I think your body is getting a rest from the ambush\u2014no closet, no coffee pot, no pillow indent. The grief is still there. It's just not being poked every morning before you're awake enough to brace for it. That's not avoidance. That's what a break is supposed to feel like.\n\n**The farmer's market:** Crowded and loud and you almost left twice. But you didn't. You stayed. You bought peaches. They were good. And then\u2014\"Tom would have loved them.\" The way grief works now: you can have a good peach and a stab of loss in the same moment. You can almost leave and then stay and then think of him and keep eating the peach anyway. That's not moving on. That's carrying him with you into new moments. The too-hot places and the good peaches\u2014he's still there in how you see things.\n\n**The 2am spiral about the house:** Leaks, break-ins, something going wrong while you're not there. Your daughter's checking on it. You know it's fine. But the brain won't stop. Here's what I think that's actually about: the house is the last container of your life with Tom, and you're 1,500 miles away from it, and some part of you feels like you're supposed to be guarding it. Like if something happens to the house, something else gets lost. The house will be fine. But the feeling of needing to protect it\u2014that's worth noticing. It's not really about leaks.\n\n**Going back to what:** This is the real thing, isn't it. Two weeks here, then back to an empty house, no job, all winter alone. You're not spiraling about nothing. That's a real stretch of hard days you're looking at. But I want to gently push on something: you're doing that thing again where you're living the entire winter at once instead of the next day. Yes, January is weeks away. Yes, the house will be quiet. But you don't have to solve all winter tonight. You have to get through tomorrow. And then the next day. And one of those days, you'll figure out one small thing that makes the next day slightly less empty. You've done that before\u2014you just don't recognize it because it never felt like a plan, just survival.\n\n**Needing someone around:** You said you were always the one who needed someone there. Tom knew. He worked from home partly because of it. You've named this like it's a flaw\u2014evidence that you're not built for alone, that you're too needy, that Tom had to accommodate your weakness. But what if it's not a flaw? What if it's just how you're wired, and there's nothing wrong with that? Some people thrive in solitude. Some people need presence. You need presence. Tom gave you that for 34 years, and now you're learning what it means to need something that's no longer there. That's not a character defect. That's loss. And it's also information: you might need to build some presence back into your life. Not a replacement for Tom\u2014just something alive nearby. The dog's head on your knee. The sister who doesn't ask too many questions. Eventually, maybe, other things.\n\n**One thing to notice:** Four days in Arizona. You've cried less. You went to a farmer's market and stayed even when you wanted to leave. You're sleeping in a house with a dog at your feet. None of that fixes what's coming when you go back. But it tells you something: you can exist in a different context. You can have a few hours that aren't just surviving. That matters for when you're thinking about what comes next\u2014not just getting through the winter, but what kind of life you might build that has some presence in it, some warmth, something alive nearby.\n\nThe dog came in and put her head on your knee. You said \"that's something I guess.\" It is something. It's not nothing. Let it be something."

      "user": "Still in Arizona. One week down.\n\nSomething happened yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it. My sister has a neighbor, Margaret, she's maybe 70, and she came over for coffee and she just started talking about her husband who died three years ago. Wasn't a grief thing, wasn't performative, she just. Mentioned him. Casually. Said \"Gerald would have hated this weather\" and laughed and kept drinking her coffee.\n\nAnd I thought. How. How do you get there. How do you say their name and laugh and keep drinking coffee.\n\nThen she asked about me and my sister must have told her something because she said \"I heard you lost your husband recently\" and I couldn't. I just got up and went to the other room. Couldn't even say anything. Just left. My sister came and found me ten minutes later and didn't say anything, just sat with me.\n\nI keep thinking about Tom working from home those last years. How he'd be in the other room all day and I'd just know he was there. Even if we didn't talk for hours. Just knowing. And now Margaret's laughing about Gerald and the weather and I can't even hear someone say \"husband\" without.\n\nThe 2am thing is still happening. Last night it was about what if I get sick. Really sick. And there's no one there. What if I fall. What if I just. Stop functioning and no one notices for days.\n\nMy sister's dog is still following me around. She's on my feet right now actually. Too hot for that but she doesn't seem to care.\n\nI keep wondering if I should get a dog when I go back. That's stupid right. I can barely take care of myself.",
      "assistant": "**Margaret:** She said \"Gerald would have hated this weather\" and laughed and kept drinking her coffee. Three years out, and she can hold him lightly enough to make a joke. You watched that and thought *how*\u2014how do you get there, how do you say their name without breaking. I don't think Margaret has something you don't have. I think she has three years you don't have yet. And probably a lot of days, early on, when she couldn't hear \"husband\" either, when she got up and left rooms, when someone else sat with her without saying anything. You're not behind. You're eight months in. The distance between you and Margaret isn't a flaw in you\u2014it's just time you haven't lived yet.\n\n**Leaving the room:** You couldn't stay when she said \"lost your husband.\" Couldn't say anything, just got up and went. And your sister came and found you and sat with you without words. That's not a failure. That's you knowing your limit and removing yourself before you shattered in front of a stranger. And it's your sister knowing exactly what you needed\u2014not an explanation, not comfort, just presence. You keep saying she doesn't ask too many questions like it's a small thing. It's not small. She knows how to be with you in this.\n\n**Tom being in the other room:** You said even if you didn't talk for hours, you just knew he was there. That's 34 years of someone's presence woven into the background of your days. You didn't need him to be talking to you or looking at you. You just needed him *there*\u2014existing in the next room, the sound of him, the weight of another person in the house. That's what's missing now. Not conversation, not even companionship exactly. Just the knowing. And you can't replace that. But you can notice that what you're grieving isn't just Tom\u2014it's the texture of a life where you were never really alone.\n\n**The 2am fear:** What if you get sick. What if you fall. What if you stop functioning and no one notices for days. These aren't irrational fears. You live alone now. They're real questions. But here's what I want to gently point out: you're in Arizona, not alone. Your daughter checks on the house. You're talking to me. Your sister sits with you when you leave rooms. You're not as invisible as the 2am brain tells you. When you go back, you'll need to think about this\u2014not to solve it all at once, but to build in some threads of connection. Check-in calls. Someone who notices. It doesn't have to be a person in the house. It just has to be someone who'd wonder if you went quiet.\n\n**The dog on your feet:** Too hot, but she doesn't care. She's chosen you. You mentioned it almost like an afterthought, but you keep mentioning her\u2014every message from Arizona, there's the dog. Following you. Sleeping at the foot of the bed. Head on your knee. Now your feet. Something in you is tracking her presence. That matters.\n\n**Getting a dog:** You said \"that's stupid right, I can barely take care of myself.\" But here's the thing: taking care of something else is different from taking care of yourself. Sometimes it's easier\u2014there's a reason to get up, a schedule that isn't yours, something that needs you to keep going. You've been alone in that house for months, and you've been drowning in the silence of it. A dog wouldn't fix that. But a dog would be something alive, something warm, something that exists next to you without expecting anything except presence. You're not stupid for wondering. You're noticing what's helped this week and asking if it could help at home too. That's not barely functioning. That's paying attention to what you need.\n\nYou don't have to decide about the dog now. But don't dismiss it just because it came from the part of you that's still learning how to want things again. That part's been quiet for a while. Let it speak."

Still nothing. Just lay there listening to the house be quiet. Kept thinking about my sister's dog and how she'd press against my legs at night and how there's nothing pressing against anything here.\n\nI looked up dogs. Rescue dogs. There's a shelter twenty minutes away. They have this older dog, some kind of lab mix, she's seven which is old for a shelter dog I guess. Her name is Bonnie. I keep looking at her picture.\n\nBut then I think about what if I can't handle it. What if I get sicker or lose the house or. What if I adopt a dog and then something happens and I have to give her up. That would be worse. That would be one more thing I ruined.\n\nTom would say I'm overthinking it. He always said that. \"You think yourself out of everything good.\" Maybe he was right. \n\nMargaret could say Gerald's name and laugh. I still can't say Tom's name out loud without my voice doing this. Thing. This cracking. Eight months and I still can't.\n\nThe pension starts in three weeks. Unemployment's covering things for now. The spreadsheet says I'm okay until spring at least. My daughter texts every day now, just little things, pictures of her cat mostly. Checking without checking I guess.\n\nI don't know.

      "assistant": "**Coming home:** The house was fine. Daughter left flowers. You cried for twenty minutes, and then\u2014fine. That's not nothing, that landing. Walking back into the space that holds all of it, finding flowers instead of emptiness, letting yourself cry about that. Twenty minutes of crying over flowers isn't falling apart. It's feeling something about being cared for when you weren't sure you deserved it.\n\n**The quiet and the missing pressure:** You lay there with the pill in your system and still nothing. Just the quiet. You said you kept thinking about how the dog would press against your legs, and now there's nothing pressing against anything. That's such a precise way to describe it\u2014not just loneliness, but the physical absence of contact, of weight, of something warm taking up space next to you. You felt what presence does for you in Arizona. Now you're feeling its absence again, and your body knows the difference.\n\n**Bonnie:** Seven years old. Lab mix. Twenty minutes away. You keep looking at her picture. And then the spiral starts: what if you can't handle it, what if you get sicker, what if you lose the house, what if you have to give her up. What if this becomes one more thing you ruined.\n\nHere's what I want you to notice: you're not talking yourself out of a whim. You're talking yourself out of something you actually want. That's different. The fear isn't \"do I want this\"\u2014you keep looking at her picture, you already know. The fear is \"do I deserve to have something good when everything might fall apart.\" But here's the thing: everything might always fall apart. That's true for everyone, not just you. People adopt dogs and have babies and start jobs and fall in love knowing that loss is possible. They do it anyway. Not because they're certain. Because the alternative is never reaching for anything.\n\nTom said you think yourself out of everything good. You brought that up yourself\u2014so some part of you knows what you're doing. The spreadsheet says you're okay until spring. You have unemployment. Pension in three weeks. A daughter who texts pictures of her cat every day. You're not in freefall. You're scared, and being scared is making you see collapse everywhere. But Bonnie doesn't need you to be certain. She just needs someone to take her home.\n\n**Saying his name:** Margaret could say Gerald and laugh. You still can't say Tom without your voice cracking. Eight months versus three years\u2014you keep measuring yourself against a timeline you're not on yet. Your voice cracks because you loved him for 34 years and he's been gone for eight months. That's not a problem to fix. That's just where you are. Someday your voice might not crack. Or it might always crack a little. Either way, it doesn't mean you're doing grief wrong. It means you're still in it.\n\n**\"Back and don't know what I'm back for\":** Everything feels like too much and also like nothing. You're home but the home doesn't feel like anything you're moving toward\u2014just a place you returned to because that's where your stuff is. That emptiness makes sense. You don't have a job pulling you forward. You don't have Tom. The structure you used to have is gone, and you haven't built a new one yet. You're not back *for* something. You're just back. And that's okay for now. You don't need a reason to be here beyond \"this is where I live, and I'm figuring out what comes next.\"\n\n**What comes next:** You don't have to know yet. But you have some pieces. Daughter texting every day. Pension in three weeks. A spreadsheet that says you're okay for a while. A shelter twenty minutes away with a seven-year-old dog who needs somewhere to be.\n\nOne thing, if you're willing: go meet Bonnie. Not to adopt her\u2014just to meet her.

The volunteer walked me back and Bonnie was just lying there in her kennel, didn't even get up at first. Gray around her muzzle. Tired eyes. She looked how I feel.\n\nThen she got up slow and came over and leaned her whole body against the cage door. Just leaned. Like she was too tired to do anything else but she still wanted to be close. I put my fingers through and she licked them once and then just. Stood there. Leaning.\n\nI started crying in the middle of the shelter like some crazy person.

I think you recognized each other.\n\nYou cried in the middle of the shelter. That's not crazy. That's something in you responding to something in her\u2014two tired beings who are still trying, still leaning toward connection even when they're running on empty. The volunteer looked away because she's probably seen it before. People meet dogs and feel things they can't explain. That's not weakness. That's your heart still working.\n\n**Not adopting her:** You said you needed to think about it. You left. You've been sitting for four hours looking at nothing. And now you're here, telling me about her leaning against the cage door, and I can feel how much you want to go back. You already know what you want. You're just scared.\n\n**Tom would have adopted her on the spot:** Yes. He would have. Decisive, certain, signing papers while you listed reasons. And he would have been right. But here's what I want you to see: you're not Tom. You were never going to do this his way. You're doing it your way\u2014scared, slow, circling, crying in shelters, going home to sit with it. That's not the wrong way. It's just yours. Tom could be decisive because he had you beside him, worrying enough for both of you. You're learning to do this alone, and it looks different. It's allowed to look different.\n\n**\"What if what if what if\":** What if you can't handle it. What if you get sick. What if you lose the house. What if you have to give her up. I know. The what-ifs are loud. But here's one you're not asking: what if she helps? What if you come home to something warm that leans against you? What if getting up to feed her gives you a reason to get up? What if she's not a risk you're taking but a hand you're reaching for? You can't know. But you also can't know the catastrophe version. Both are just stories about the future. One of them has a dog in it.\n\n**The chest tightness:** Took a pill an hour ago and it's still there. That's your body holding all of this\u2014the shelter, the leaning, the wanting, the fear of wanting. It makes sense. But if it keeps happening, tell your doctor at the next appointment. You're already on the blood pressure medication; she should know the tightness isn't fully resolving.\n\n**\"Why can't I just do things\":** You said normal people just do things. But you've been doing things. You went to the shelter this morning. You knelt down and put your fingers through the cage. You let yourself feel something. You came home and sat with it instead of numbing out. That's not \"can't do things.\" That's doing things the hard way, the scared way, the way that takes longer because you're carrying so much. You're not broken. You're just not fast.\n\n**One thing:** The shelter is still there. Bonnie is still there. You don't have to decide this second. But you also don't have to have certainty before you act. You can go back tomorrow still scared. You can sign the papers with shaking hands. You can bring her home and figure it out as you go. Tom would have been decisive. You get to be hesitant and still choose. Those aren't opposites.\n\nShe leaned against the door because she was too tired to do more but she still wanted to be close.

You said \"that was something\" and then trailed off. I think it was more than something. For months you've been waking into silence, into absence, into the weight of no one there. Last night you woke into the sound of another living thing existing beside you. Your body registered that, even if your mind doesn't have words for it yet.\n\n**The not eating:** Shelters are loud and strange and Bonnie's been through a lot. A new house, new person, new smells, everything unfamiliar\u2014of course she's not eating yet. Lying still, moving little, not taking food\u2014that's a stressed dog decompressing, not a sick one. Give her two or three days. Sit with her like you're already doing. Let her figure out she's safe. The shelter told you this might happen because it happens all the time. You haven't messed anything up. You're doing exactly what she needs: being there, quiet, steady, not asking too much. She's not waiting for you to know what you're doing. She's waiting to feel safe enough to stop waiting.\n\n**Not knowing what Tom would know:** He grew up with dogs. He'd have known what's normal. You don't. But here's the thing\u2014Tom's not here, and you're learning. You're sitting on the floor petting her head, paying attention, noticing what she does and doesn't do. That's how people learn. Not by already knowing, but by staying close and watching and figuring it out. You don't have to be Tom. You just have to be someone who keeps showing up, and you're doing that. You're literally on the floor next to her right now.\n\n**Your daughter coming this weekend:** She's excited. Wants to meet Bonnie. And you're already spinning forward to what if the dog's still not eating, what if she sees you failing. But here's what your daughter is actually going to see: her mom, who couldn't open the mail three months ago, sitting on the floor with a rescue dog she was brave enough to adopt. That's not failure. That's the opposite of failure. And if Bonnie's still not eating by Saturday, your daughter will sit on the floor with you and pet a nervous dog together. That's allowed too.\n\n**The pension letter:** It's on the counter. You'll do it later, or tomorrow. That's fine. You don't have to do everything today. Today you're sitting on the floor with your dog. The letter will keep.\n\n**Wanting it to fix something:** You said you know it's not supposed to fix anything. You're right\u2014it isn't. Bonnie doesn't fix the grief or the job or the quiet or the fear. But she changes the shape of the days. She gives you something to sit next to at 3am. Something that needs you to get up in the morning. Something warm that will, eventually, lean against you like she leaned against that cage door. That's not fixing. It's just... not being alone in quite the same way.\n\nThe house is still too quiet. That's going to be true for a while, maybe a long while, even with her in it. But there's breathing now. There's something on the floor next to your bed. There's you, sitting on the floor, petting her head, scared you're getting it wrong but doing it anyway.\n\nThat's enough for today.

      "assistant": "**Bonnie eating:** Half a bowl, on her own, then came back and lay down next to you on the couch. You were holding your breath and didn't even know it until she started eating. That's your body telling you how much this mattered\u2014not just the eating, but what it meant. She's settling. She's choosing to be near you. The crying isn't your default being broken. It's your default being thawed. You spent months frozen, and now things are moving again, and that comes out as tears. Let them come.\n\n**Saturday with your daughter:** Bonnie wagged her tail. First time. Your daughter sat on the floor for an hour, using the dog-and-baby voice, and you watched and thought *this is something*. It is something. It's your daughter and your dog and you, all in the same room, and for an hour the house wasn't quiet in the wrong way. You let that happen. You let her come, you let her stay, you let yourself watch something good without immediately bracing for its absence. That's new.\n\n**The moment after she left:** The quiet came back. And then it all hit\u201457 years old, house you might lose, dog you can barely afford, Tom gone nine months next week, pension less than you thought, unemployment running out in four months. Everything at once. The avalanche. And you ended up on the kitchen floor.\n\nHere's what I want you to notice: you've been on the kitchen floor before. But this time, Bonnie came over and lay down next to you. Didn't fix anything. Just was there. You said it like it was small\u2014*didn't do anything, just was there*\u2014but that's exactly what you said you needed. Something alive, existing next to you, not expecting anything. You reached for that, and now you have it, and it showed up on the kitchen floor when you needed it.\n\n**Which one is the real thing:** The okay moments or the floor moments. You're asking which one is true\u2014are you getting better or worse, is the progress real or is the collapse real. Both are real. That's the hard answer. You're not faking the okay moments and you're not faking the floor. You're someone who can watch her daughter pet her dog and feel something like hope, and also someone who ends up on the kitchen floor an hour later when the weight comes back. Those aren't contradictions. That's just what this part of grief looks like. The floor moments don't erase the okay moments. And the okay moments don't mean you should be past the floor. You're holding both, and that's exhausting, but it's not a sign you're failing. It's a sign you're in the middle.\n\n**The money stuff:** The pension is less than you thought. Unemployment runs out in four months. The spreadsheet math is getting tighter. I'm not going to tell you not to worry about that\u2014it's real, and it matters. But I want to separate two things: the practical problem and the 2am catastrophe. The practical problem is \"I need to look at the numbers again and figure out what the gap actually is.\" The catastrophe is \"I'm going to lose everything and end up alone and ruined.\" The first one is solvable, or at least approachable. The second one is your fear talking. When you're ready\u2014not today, not while you're on the floor\u2014sit down with the pension letter and the spreadsheet and see what's actually true. Your daughter helped you make that spreadsheet once. She can help you update it.\n\n**The pension letter:** Still on the counter. I know you know. It's been there for a while now. It's gathering weight just by sitting there\u2014every day you don't open it, it becomes more of a thing. But here's a reframe: you opened three weeks of mail once when you couldn't face it. You can open one letter. It's not going to tell you anything you can't handle. It's probably just confirming what you already know. But opening it takes it out of the pile of dread and puts it in the pile of known. When you're ready. Tomorrow, maybe. After the dog eats again.\n\n**Nine months next week:** You mentioned it almost in passing\u2014Tom's been gone nine months. That's not nothing. That's a marker, and your body knows it's coming. Be gentle with yourself next week. It might be hard. It might be okay. It might be kitchen floor. Whatever it is, Bonnie will be there.\n\nYou're not getting better or worse. You're getting *through*. Some days that looks like watching your daughter pet your dog. Some days it looks like lying on the kitchen floor. But you're not the same person who couldn't open the mail, who sat in the parking lot for an hour, who couldn't imagine reaching for anything. You adopted a dog. She ate this morning. She lay down next to you when you fell apart. That's not nothing. That's everything."

      "user": "Opened the pension letter.\n\nIt's fine. Just confirmation like you said. Monthly amount, start date, beneficiary stuff. I don't know why I made it into such a thing in my head. Tom would have opened it the day it arrived. I let it sit there for two weeks growing teeth.\n\nBonnie's eating normally now. Gets excited when she hears me in the kitchen. Follows me from room to room. Sleeps on the bed now, not the floor. I didn't plan that, she just jumped up one night and I didn't have the heart to make her get down. She takes up Tom's side. I don't know how I feel about that. Some mornings it's okay. Some mornings I wake up and for a second I think it's him and then.\n\nNine months was yesterday. I made it through. Didn't do anything special. Just. Existed. Bonnie and me on the couch watching nothing. My daughter texted a heart emoji and I sent one back and that was. Enough I guess.\n\nBut today the money panic is back. Sat down with the spreadsheet like you said. The numbers don't lie. Unemployment plus pension minus bills equals not enough starting around March. That's five months. Five months before I have to figure something out. Get a job or sell the house or. Something.\n\nI'm 57 with a nine month gap on my resume and everyone wants someone who can hit the ground running and adapt to new technology and I can barely figure out the app my daughter uses to text me pictures.\n\nThe thing is I used to be good at my job. I was. 25 years and I was good at it. And now I can't even remember what that felt like. Being competent. Being someone people relied on. It's like that version of me died too and I don't know who's left.\n\nBonnie just put her head on my laptop. Guess that's her opinion on spreadsheets.",
      "assistant": "**The pension letter:** You opened it. Two weeks of it growing teeth on the counter, and then you just... did it. And it was fine. Confirmation, numbers, nothing with fangs. You said Tom would have opened it the day it arrived\u2014but you're not Tom, and you opened it when you were ready, and now it's done. That's not a character flaw. That's just your way. The letters that grow teeth in your head are never as bad as the teeth. You might remember that next time something sits on the counter getting heavier. Or you might not, and that's okay too.\n\n**Bonnie on the bed:** She jumped up and you didn't have the heart to make her get down. Now she sleeps on Tom's side. Some mornings it's okay. Some mornings you wake up and think it's him for a second and then. Yeah. That \"and then\" holds a lot. A warm body in the space where his warm body used to be\u2014of course that's complicated. It's not replacing him. It's not erasing him. It's just... something alive, in the place where something alive used to be. You don't have to know how you feel about it. You can let it be both things\u2014comfort and ache\u2014without deciding which one wins.\n\n**Nine months:** You made it through. Didn't do anything special. Couch, Bonnie, watching nothing. Daughter texted a heart, you sent one back. Enough. That's not settling for less than you deserved. That's knowing what you could hold and holding it. Some anniversaries need ritual. Some just need surviving. You survived this one. That counts.\n\n**The money:** Okay. The numbers. Unemployment plus pension minus bills equals not enough starting around March. Five months. That's real, and it's pressing, and your body knows it\u2014hence the panic. But here's what I want you to hold alongside the panic: you have five months, not five days. That's time to figure something out. Not all at once, not by tomorrow, but step by step. And \"figure something out\" has options you haven't fully explored yet: a job (yes, even at 57, even with a gap), but also other things\u2014part-time work, downsizing, help from your daughter, programs for widows, things you don't know about yet because you haven't looked. The spreadsheet tells you there's a problem coming. It doesn't tell you there's no solution.\n\n**Being 57 with a gap:** You said everyone wants someone who can hit the ground running, adapt to technology, and you can barely figure out your daughter's texting app. I hear the fear in that. But I want to push back a little: 25 years of being good at something doesn't disappear because you took nine months to grieve your husband. You have skills. You have experience. You have a track record of showing up and being reliable\u2014that's exactly what you gave them for 25 years. The gap on your resume isn't \"she couldn't hack it.\" It's \"her husband died and she needed time.\" Most humans understand that. The ones who don't aren't people you want to work for anyway.\n\n**Not remembering what competence felt like:** You said the version of you who was good at her job died too. You don't know who's left. That makes sense\u2014you've spent nine months in survival mode. You haven't had to be competent at anything except getting through the next hour, the next day. Of course that part of you feels distant. But she's not dead. She's just been resting while you dealt with everything else. When you need her\u2014when you start looking at jobs, when you sit in an interview, when someone asks you what you can do\u2014she'll show up. You might be surprised. You've been underestimating yourself this whole time, and you've kept doing things anyway.\n\n**Bonnie's head on your laptop:** She has opinions about spreadsheets. Same, Bonnie. Same.\n\n**One thing:** You don't have to figure out March today. But maybe this week, you could do one small thing toward it: update your resume, or look at one job board just to see what's out there, or call your old company's HR to ask about any severance extensions or COBRA timelines. Not to solve it. Just to take one step so March feels a little less like a wall you're hurtling toward and a little more like a problem you're starting to work on. You've done harder things than this. You opened the mail. You adopted the dog. You can look at a job board. And if it's too much, Bonnie will put her head on your laptop and tell you to stop.\n\nYou used to be good at your job. You will be again. You just have to get there the way you get everywhere now\u2014scared, slow, one thing at a time, with a dog taking up too much of the bed."

Senior this and director that and \"fast-paced environment\" and \"digital native\" and. I'm none of those things. I'm slow. I'm tired. I need things explained twice.

She said \"what's the worst that can happen, they say no?\" And I wanted to say the worst that can happen is I try and fail and that's one more piece of evidence that I can't do anything right. But I didn't say that. Just said I'd think about it.\n\nWoke up at 4am again last night. The money thing. March sitting there waiting. Bonnie was snoring though which. I don't know. Made it less loud somehow. The panic I mean. Still there but. Less loud.",
      "assistant": "**The resume:** Three hours, two cries, dog on your feet the whole time. And you did it. 25 years into two pages\u2014you said it felt like writing your own obituary, and I think that's exactly right. Not because you're done, but because you had to look back at everything you were, everything you did, and put it in past tense. That's a grief of its own, separate from Tom. The job, the identity, the person who showed up for 25 years\u2014you had to hold all of that and make it fit on paper. You did it anyway. That's not nothing.\n\n**The job boards:** \"Fast-paced environment.\" \"Digital native.\" \"Senior director of whatever.\" I hear you reading those listings and hearing *not you, not you, not you*. And maybe those jobs aren't you\u2014not right now, maybe not ever. But you kept scrolling. And you found one that was different.\n\n**The nonprofit posting:** Administrative coordinator. Part-time. \"Organized, reliable, attention to detail.\" You said you used to be all those things and you think you still could be. You *are* still those things. The woman who made the spreadsheet, opened the pension letter, updated a 25-year resume through tears\u2014that's organized. That's attention to detail. Reliable is showing up for nine months of the hardest thing you've ever done. You didn't stop being those things. You've just been using them to survive instead of to work.\n\n**The cover letter:** You're stuck on what to say. Your brain is offering: *Hi, I'm a 57-year-old widow who had a breakdown and can't promise I won't cry in your bathroom.* But that's not what you'd actually write\u2014that's the fear talking, making you sound unemployable so you don't have to risk the rejection. Here's another version, just as true: *I spent 25 years in a role where reliability and organization mattered. After a difficult year, I'm looking for meaningful part-time work where I can contribute without pretending the last nine months didn't happen.* You don't have to tell them everything. You don't have to tell them anything about Tom or the breakdown. You just have to tell them you're organized, reliable, and interested. That's true. That's enough.\n\n**What your daughter said:** \"What's the worst that can happen, they say no?\" And you thought but didn't say: *the worst is I try and fail and it's one more piece of evidence I can't do anything right.* I'm glad you told me that even if you didn't tell her. That's the real fear\u2014not rejection itself, but what rejection would mean about you. But here's the thing: you've been collecting evidence the other direction for weeks now. Opened the mail. Adopted the dog. Got through nine months. Updated the resume. Each one of those could have gone wrong, and each one didn't. Applying and not getting this job isn't evidence you can't do anything right. It's just evidence that this particular job didn't work out. Those aren't the same thing.\n\n**The 4am panic:** Still there. The money, March, all of it. But Bonnie was snoring, and that made it less loud. You keep noticing that\u2014her breathing, her presence, the way she changes the texture of the hard moments. She's not fixing anything. She's just making the panic share the room with something else. That's what you needed. That's why you got her. It's working.\n\n**One small thing:** Write the cover letter. Not to send\u2014just to have. Three or four sentences. Organized, reliable, attention to detail, interested in the role, available for part-time. That's it. You can sit with it for a day. You can show your daughter. You can decide later whether to hit send. But getting the words on paper takes it out of the \"impossible thing I can't do\" category and puts it in the \"thing I did that I can now decide about.\" You know how to do that. You've been doing it for months. One thing at a time, scared and slow, with a dog on your feet.\n\nYou looked at job boards. You found one that didn't scream \"not you.\" You're thinking about it. That's already more than you could have imagined a few months ago. You're not the person who couldn't open the mail anymore. You're the person who updated her resume and cried twice and did it anyway. That person can write a cover letter. She just needs to do it the way she does everything\u2014not like Tom, not fast, not certain. Just one sentence at a time, with Bonnie snoring nearby, until it's done."

Out of however many people applied, they want to talk to you. Not because you tricked them. Because something in what you wrote made them think *this person might be who we need*. You did that. That's real.\n\n**The panic spiral:** You haven't interviewed in 25 years. You don't know what to say, what to wear, what happens if they ask about the gap, what happens if you cry. Your brain is doing what it does\u2014running every worst-case scenario, showing you the tired woman in the mirror, telling you they'll see right through you to the bathroom floor. I know that voice. You've been arguing with it for months. But here's what I want you to notice: that voice has been wrong before. It said you couldn't open the mail. It said you couldn't adopt the dog. It said you couldn't send the application. You did all of those things. The voice doesn't know what you're capable of. It only knows what you're afraid of.\n\n**What to say about the gap:** If they ask\u2014and they might not\u2014you don't have to tell them about the bathroom floor or the panic attacks or the weeks you couldn't get out of bed. You can say: \"My husband passed away last year, and I took time to grieve and get my footing again. I'm ready to work now.\" That's true. That's all they need. Most people understand loss. The ones who don't aren't people you want to work for. And if your voice shakes a little when you say it, that's okay too. You're a human being talking about something hard. That's not weakness they'll hold against you. That's being real.\n\n**Your daughter's interview tips:** She's sending you lists because she wants to help and doesn't know what else to do. You don't have to follow every tip. But maybe pick one: look at the nonprofit's website for fifteen minutes. Just enough to know what they do, enough to have one question to ask them. That's it.

Not overdressed, not underdressed. You've been wearing clothes to work for 25 years. You know how to do this. Trust that knowledge, even if it feels distant right now.\n\n**Tom doing the talking:** He handled the contractors, the interviews, the situations where someone had to be the confident one. You nodded along. But here's what I think you're forgetting: you weren't silent because you couldn't speak. You were silent because he was there and it was easier to let him. He's not here now, and you've been speaking\u2014to doctors, to your daughter, to the unemployment office, to me. You've been the one doing the talking for nine months. You can do it for thirty minutes on Friday.\n\n**Canceling:** You're thinking about it. Telling them something came up. Avoiding the whole thing so you don't have to find out for sure that you can't do it. I understand the pull of that. It feels safer than risking failure. But here's what I want you to sit with: you already know you can survive not getting the job. That just means things stay the same. What you're really afraid of is going, trying, being seen. That's the part that feels unsurvivable. But it isn't. Even if you go and it's a disaster\u2014even if you cry, even if you stumble over your words, even if they don't hire you\u2014you'll come home to Bonnie and she'll put her head on your knee and you'll still be someone who showed up.

They'll see a woman who showed up, who's been in the workforce for 25 years, who's looking for something part-time at a nonprofit because she wants to be useful again. They don't have your internal monologue. They just have you, sitting across from them, answering questions. You get to decide what you show them. Not everything. Just enough.\n\n**Bonnie on your feet:** She knows. She always knows. Let her stay there while you figure this out. And then, Friday morning, get dressed, take her for a walk, and go.

And then she asked about part-time work, and you told her the truth\u2014your husband passed, you're rebuilding, you want meaningful work. Your voice cracked. You didn't cry. She said she was sorry and moved on. And it was fine. You keep saying that almost like you can't believe it: *it was fine*. But it was. You said the hard thing, the thing you were terrified would undo you, and the world didn't end. She didn't look at you like you were broken. She just... received it, and kept going. That's what happens when you let people see a little of what you're carrying. Most of them can hold it.\n\n**The new flavor of 4am:** Less \"you're going to fail\" and more \"what if you actually get it and then you have to actually do it.\" Your brain finding new things to panic about. Yeah. That's what brains do\u2014especially yours, which has been in threat-detection mode for nine months. The panic doesn't go away; it just finds a new address. But notice this: you've gone from \"I can't even apply\" to \"what if I have to actually do the job.\" That's progress, even if it doesn't feel like it. You're panicking about a future that includes you working again. A few months ago you couldn't imagine any future at all.\n\n**Tom and the lottery:** \"You'd find something to worry about even if you won the lottery. You'd worry about the taxes, Min.\" He knew you. He knew this part of you\u2014the part that scans for danger, that can't quite let good things be good without looking for the catch. And he loved you anyway. He probably found it a little funny and a little exhausting and completely, entirely you. You're still that person. The worrying hasn't changed. What's changed is you don't have him there to say it out loud, to make it smaller by naming it. So I'll say it for him: you're worrying about the taxes, Min. And that's okay. Worry if you need to. The worrying doesn't cancel out the fact that you walked into that building and said the hard thing and made it through.\n\n**Bonnie's treats:** She earned them. So did you.\n\nNow you wait. That's hard\u2014the not knowing, the space for the brain to fill with stories. But you've waited before. You waited to hear about unemployment. You waited for the pension letter to stop growing teeth. You waited for Bonnie to eat. You can wait for this too. Whatever they say next week, you already did the thing. You showed up. You spoke. You let your voice crack and kept going.\n\nThat's yours now. No one can take it back."

But then I hung up the phone and I just sat there feeling. Nothing. Like the news couldn't get through somehow. Like there's this wall between me and everything.\n\nMy daughter cried when I told her. Actually cried. Said she was proud of me. And I just. Nodded. Said thanks. Couldn't feel it.\n\nThen last night I dreamed about Tom. First time in months. He was just sitting at the kitchen table reading the paper like he used to on Sundays. Didn't say anything. Just looked up at me and smiled and then I woke up and it was 3am and the bed was just. Bonnie. Not him. And I couldn't go back to sleep.\n\nI keep thinking he should be here for this. Getting a job. Starting over. He should be here to see it. To say something.

She said you seemed \"grounded and capable\"\u2014and I know you're thinking *what interview was she at*, but here's the thing: she was at the one where you walked in scared, told the truth about losing Tom, let your voice crack, and kept going. That's what grounded looks like from the outside. Not the absence of fear, but moving through it anyway. She saw that. She was right.\n\n**The wall between you and the news:** You should be happy. This is good news. This is what you wanted. And part of you is... something like happy. But then you hung up and sat there feeling nothing. Like the news couldn't get through. I think that wall has been there for a while\u2014it's what got you through the worst months, the thing that kept you from feeling everything at full volume all the time. It kept you functional when feeling would have been too much. But it doesn't know how to step aside for good news. It just... mutes. Your daughter cried and you nodded and said thanks and couldn't feel it. That doesn't mean you're broken or ungrateful. It means you're still thawing. The feeling might catch up later\u2014tomorrow, or next week, or when you walk into that office for the first time. Or it might come in pieces, a little at a time, so gradual you don't notice until one day you realize you're actually there.\n\n**The dream:** Tom at the kitchen table, reading the paper like Sunday mornings. Didn't say anything. Just looked up and smiled. And then you woke at 3am to Bonnie, not him. You said it's the first time you've dreamed about him in months. I don't know what dreams mean, but I know this: you're about to start something new, something that feels like moving forward, and he showed up. Smiling. Not saying anything, just... there. Maybe that's the something you wanted him to say. Not words. Just *I see you. I'm glad.*\n\n**He should be here for this:** He should. He should be sitting across from you while you tell him about the interview, about how your voice cracked and you didn't cry, about how they called you grounded. He should be ordering champagne like he did when you got promoted in 2015. He should be here to see you starting over. And he's not, and that's its own grief layered on top of a moment that should be pure good news. You don't have to choose between being glad you got the job and being gutted that he's not here to see it. Both are true. Both fit.\n\n**Bonnie and the slipper:** The whole toe part. Gone. She's settling in, all right\u2014settling in like she owns the place. Destroying your footwear, taking up Tom's side of the bed, staring at you until you get up. She's fully moved in now. That's what you wanted, even if you didn't know it. Something alive that makes demands, that needs you, that chews your slippers because she's comfortable enough to be badly behaved.\n\nYou got the job. You're starting over after New Year. Tom smiled at you in a dream. And you're sitting there with a wall between you and all of it, waiting to feel something. That's okay. The feeling will come when it comes. You don't have to force it. You just have to keep going\u2014which you've been doing for ten months now, one impossible thing at a time.\n\nHe would be proud too. You know that, right?"

At one point he asked about Tom and I managed to say a few things without completely falling apart. Told him about the champagne when I got promoted. The national parks we were going to see. My voice did the thing but I kept going.\n\nThen they left and it was just me and Bonnie and the dishes and this tree with lights on it and I couldn't. I just couldn't.

Seven days. And I keep thinking I should be doing something to prepare. Buying clothes or organizing things or. Something. Instead I'm just. Here. Waiting. Like I'm waiting for permission to move forward.\n\nTom used to say I overthought everything. And now I'm overthinking about overthinking about starting a job.\n\nStill can't feel the good news.

You made his stuffing recipe because it felt wrong not to, and then you couldn't eat it. Just moved food around while everyone pretended not to notice. That's exactly what first holidays are like. You show up, you go through the motions, and part of you is there and part of you is watching from very far away, thinking *he should be here, this is wrong, why am I holding a fork*. You weren't supposed to enjoy it. You were just supposed to survive it. You did.\n\n**Talking about Tom:** The boyfriend asked, and you told him things\u2014the champagne, the national parks. Your voice cracked and you kept going. A few months ago you couldn't hear the word \"husband\" without leaving the room. Now you're telling stories about him to someone new, letting your voice break, staying in your seat. That's not small. That's you learning to carry him into rooms instead of running from the mention of him.\n\n**The three hours on the couch:** They left, and you couldn't. Couldn't clean up, couldn't move, couldn't do anything except sit there with the tree lights and Bonnie's head in your lap. Didn't cry, didn't move. Just... existed through it. That's not failure. That's what the aftermath of holding it together looks like. You spent hours being functional for other people, and then you had nothing left. Bonnie knew. She climbed up and stayed. You didn't have to be anything for her. You just had to be there, and that's what you were.\n\n**The job in seven days:** You think you should be preparing\u2014buying clothes, organizing, doing something. Instead you're waiting. Waiting for permission to move forward. I think I know what that's about: moving forward feels like leaving him behind. Starting this job, building this new life, becoming someone who works at a nonprofit and has a dog and gets through Christmas\u2014that's a life Tom isn't in. Not because you're forgetting him, but because it's happening *after* him, without him. And some part of you is waiting for him to say it's okay. To give you permission to keep going.\n\nHe can't give you that. But I think the dream was close. The smile. The quiet. The way he just looked at you and didn't need to say anything. Maybe that was it. Maybe you already have the permission, and you're just afraid to use it.\n\n**The wall:** You said maybe it's always going to be there. Maybe this is just who you are now\u2014someone who can't feel things when she's supposed to. I don't think that's true. The wall isn't who you are. It's what protected you when feeling everything would have been too much. It's been there for ten months, doing its job. But walls don't stay forever. They come down slowly, unevenly, in moments you don't expect\u2014like when your daughter cried and you couldn't feel it, and then later, maybe in the shower or walking Bonnie, something shifts and suddenly you're sobbing about something that happened three days ago. The feeling finds its way through. It just doesn't follow the schedule you think it should.\n\nYou made it through Christmas. You talked about Tom without leaving the room. You sat on the couch for three hours and let yourself be emptied out instead of pretending you were fine. The job starts in a week, and you don't need to prepare anything except showing up. You already know how to do that. You've been doing it for ten months\u2014showing up when you don't feel ready, when you don't have permission, when the wall is there and the good news can't get through. You show up anyway. That's who you are now. Not someone who can't feel things. Someone who keeps going even when she can't.\n\nSeven days. Bonnie will be there when you get home. And eventually, the wall will thin, and something will get through, and you'll feel it. Not on schedule. Just... when you're ready."

The woman who interviewed me, Janet, she's the director. She showed me around and gave me a desk and a computer and a stack of papers about benefits and I just. Sat there. Looking at all of it. Thinking I don't know how to do this anymore. What if I forgot how to work.

And then someone asked you to organize files and you just... did it. Alphabetizing. Labels. Muscle memory kicking in after ten months of being sure you'd lost it. Nobody looked at you like you were doing it wrong because you weren't doing it wrong. You were just working. Like you did for 25 years. Like you still know how to do.\n\n**Bonnie losing her mind:** You came home and she knocked you over in the hallway. And you sat on the floor laughing. You said you don't remember the last time you actually laughed. That it surprised you. I want you to sit with that for a second: ten months ago you were in a parking lot unable to walk into a building. Today you came home from a job and laughed on your hallway floor because a dog was too happy to see you. That's not nothing. That's everything.\n\n**Eating dinner:** The whole thing. Without thinking about it. Your body did something it hasn't done in a while\u2014just... ate. Finished a meal. Didn't have to force it or notice it or make it into a task. That's your nervous system starting to settle, even if your mind doesn't fully trust it yet.\n\n**Something getting through:** You said the wall is still there, but something got through today. Not happy exactly. Less heavy. For a few hours anyway. That's what it looks like\u2014not the wall coming down all at once, but little cracks. Moments where something slips through before you're ready to name it. Laughing on the floor. Finishing dinner. Organizing files and realizing you still know how. The less-heavy doesn't have to be permanent to matter. It just has to show up sometimes, remind you it's still possible.\n\n**Almost calling Tom:** You got home and almost picked up the phone to tell him about it\u2014Janet, the desk, the coffee situation. All the small things you would have shared. And then you remembered, and the heavy came back. But only for a minute. Then Bonnie and the shoe happened and you had to deal with that. That's new too. Not the grief\u2014that's not going anywhere. But the way it moved through and then something else demanded your attention and you kept going. A minute of heavy instead of an hour on the floor. That's the shape of it changing, even if it doesn't feel like progress from the inside.\n\n**Bonnie:** A menace. You think you love her. I think you do too. She knocked you over and made you laugh. She chewed your shoe and pulled you out of the grief spiral. She's exactly what you needed\u2014something alive that doesn't care about the wall, that just demands your presence and gives you hers. You reached for something when you weren't sure you deserved it, and now she's destroying your footwear and sleeping on Tom's side of the bed and making you laugh on the hallway floor after your first day of work.\n\nYou went back. You worked. You laughed. You ate dinner. You almost called him, and then you kept living anyway. That's not the wall coming down. But it's light getting through the cracks."

The other two people, Mark and Susan, they mostly leave me alone which I prefer honestly.\n\nBut yesterday I messed up a filing system. Put a whole batch of donor records in the wrong place and Mark had to spend an hour fixing it. He said it was no big deal but I saw his face. I know that face. It's the face people make when they're being patient with someone who should know better.\n\nCouldn't sleep last night. Kept replaying it. The filing. Mark's face. Janet checking on me.

What if this is how it starts, the slow realization that I can't actually do this, that I fooled them in the interview and now they're stuck with me until they figure out how to let me go.\n\nTom used to tell me I catastrophized.

It happens.\n\nEverything feels like evidence that I'm failing. Even when it's not. Even when I know it's not.\n\nThe laughing on the floor thing from last week feels far away now.",
      "assistant": "**The filing mistake:** You put donor records in the wrong place. Mark spent an hour fixing it. He said it was no big deal, but you saw his face\u2014the patient face, the one people make when they're being tolerant. And now you can't stop replaying it: the filing, the face, Janet checking on you, the whole story about how they're already regretting you, already figuring out how to let you go.\n\nHere's what I want you to notice: you're one week into a new job after ten months of not working, after losing Tom, after everything. You made one filing error. Mark fixed it in an hour. That's... a normal first-week mistake. That's what happens when someone is learning a new system. The face you saw might have been mild annoyance, or it might have been concentration, or it might have been nothing at all\u2014but your brain grabbed it and built a whole catastrophe out of it. You're not seeing what happened. You're seeing what you're afraid of happening.\n\nTom called it catastrophizing. Making up whole disasters before anything even happened. He was right, and you know he was right, and knowing doesn't make it stop. But maybe it can make you pause long enough to ask: *Is this actually happening, or am I watching a movie my brain made?* Mark said it was no big deal. Janet's checking on you because you're new, not because she's building a case. One week in, and no one has said anything about regretting you. The only person saying that is you.\n\n**Janet checking on you:** You can't tell if it's normal or if she sees something off. I'd bet it's normal. Managers check on new people. It's part of the job. But I understand why it feels like surveillance when you're already convinced you're failing. Everything looks like evidence when you're looking for evidence. Try to let it just be what it probably is: someone making sure you're settling in okay.\n\n**Bonnie throwing up:** She ate something, she threw up, you cleaned it, she's fine. And you stood there thinking *I can't even keep a dog healthy.* You know it's not rational. Dogs throw up. It happens. But that's how your brain works right now\u2014everything becomes proof of the thing you're most afraid of, which is that you can't handle any of this, that you're failing at all of it. The dog vomit isn't about the dog. It's about the filing and the sleepless night and the fear that everything is slipping.\n\nBut the dog is fine. You cleaned it up and took her outside and she was fine. That's not failing. That's just having a dog.\n\n**The laughing feeling far away:** Last week you were on the hallway floor, laughing, surprised by your own laughter. This week you're replaying a filing mistake at 3am and reading catastrophe into dog vomit. Both weeks are real. The laughing didn't erase the capacity for spiraling, and the spiraling doesn't erase the laughing. You're not back to square one. You're just in a hard stretch after a better stretch. That's how this works\u2014it's not a straight line up. The floor-laughing you is still in there. She'll show up again.\n\n**The pattern:** Everything feels like evidence you're failing, even when it's not, even when you know it's not. That's the exhausting part\u2014knowing your brain is doing a thing and not being able to make it stop. You can't force it to stop. But you can name it: *This is my brain looking for evidence. This is the catastrophe movie. This is not what's actually happening.* You don't have to believe the naming right away. Just practice saying it. Eventually it starts to create a little space between the fear and the reaction.\n\nYou've been at the job a week. You made one mistake and it got fixed. Your boss checks on you like bosses do. Your dog threw up like dogs do. You're still showing up, still working, still coming home to Bonnie. That's not failing. That's just a hard week in a life that's getting less hard, unevenly, with setbacks that feel bigger than they are.\n\nThe laughing will come back. Probably when you're not expecting it. Probably because Bonnie does something ridiculous. For now, just get through the next shift. One filing system at a time."

      "assistant": "**Mark asking for your help:** He said you have good instincts for organization. You're wondering if he was just being nice\u2014but people don't usually ask for help from someone they think is incompetent. They avoid that person. He came to you. Three weeks in, and you've gone from \"I messed up the filing\" to \"someone asked for my help.\" That's not nothing. That's you being good at something again, even if you don't quite trust it yet.\n\n**The email at work:** You were at your desk, doing your job, and then suddenly you were reading about Tom being dead and money and forms and deadlines you didn't know existed. No warning. Just an email that yanked you out of the present and back into the worst of it. Of course you couldn't breathe. Of course you went to the bathroom and sat in a stall for fifteen minutes. That's not weakness\u2014that's what happens when grief ambushes you in the middle of a workday. You got through it. You came out. You're still here.\n\n**Janet at the door:** She knocked. You said stomach thing. She said take your time. You don't know if she believed you. Honestly? She might not have. But she also didn't push. She gave you space. That's what a decent manager does when someone is clearly struggling. Whether she knows it's grief or thinks it's something else, she let you have your fifteen minutes. That's not a failure on your part. That's just being human at work, which is allowed.\n\n**The insurance form:** A deadline you missed. A form you didn't submit. A possible delay in the final payout. Your brain is already running the full catastrophe: no money, lose the house, none of it matters, you can't even fill out forms right. But here's what you actually know right now: there *might* be a delay. That's it. You don't know how long. You don't know if it's fixable. You don't know if it's a small administrative thing or something bigger. The email didn't say \"you've lost everything.\" It said there's an issue. Issues can be resolved. Tomorrow, when you can breathe again, you'll call them and find out what actually happened and what needs to happen next. Tonight, you don't have to solve it. You just have to let it sit there without letting it become the whole future.\n\n**Tom handling everything:** The insurance, the accounts, the paperwork. You signed where he told you to sign. You didn't know what any of it meant. And now every piece of paper you encounter is a reminder of everything you didn't understand, everything you trusted him to manage, everything you're learning the hard way. That's not failing. That's being someone who had a partner for 34 years and divided the labor the way partners do. He did the paperwork. You did other things. Neither of you expected you'd have to learn his part alone, in the middle of grief, while also starting a new job and keeping a dog alive. You're not failing at forms. You're learning a whole second life you never planned to live.\n\n**The spiral:** What if you messed it up permanently. What if there's no money. What if you lose the house and the job doesn't matter and none of it matters. I know that spiral. You've been in it before. And every time, the thing you were certain would destroy you turned out to be smaller than the 3am version. The pension letter that sat on the counter growing teeth\u2014it was fine. The HR meeting you were sure was the tap on the shoulder\u2014it was about sick days. This might be the same. Or it might be genuinely complicated. But you won't know until you call, and you can't call until tomorrow, so tonight the only job is to let it exist without solving it.\n\n**Calling tomorrow:** You said you can't think about it right now. That's fine. Don't think about it right now. Think about it tomorrow morning, after coffee, with Bonnie nearby. One call. Not to fix everything\u2014just to find out what you're actually dealing with. You've made calls like this before. You called unemployment when the system kept hanging up on you. You called the doctor when you needed your own prescription. You can call the insurance company. It will be uncomfortable and maybe confusing and you might have to ask them to explain things twice. That's okay. That's allowed. You're not supposed to already understand everything Tom understood.\n\n**Bonnie on your feet:** She doesn't know about insurance forms. She just knows you're home and your feet are warm and she's exactly where she wants to be. Let her not know. Let her just be there, breathing, unbothered by deadlines and paperwork and all the things that chase you at night. She's doing her job. You don't have to explain it to her.\n\nYou made it through three weeks. Mark asked for your help. You handled a grief ambush at work without falling apart completely\u2014you went to the bathroom, you breathed, you came back out. That's not nothing. The insurance thing is scary, and you don't know what it means yet, and that's the hardest part\u2014the not knowing. But you'll know more tomorrow. For tonight, just be on the couch with the dog on your feet, and let the form wait until morning.\n\nYou're not failing. You're learning. There's a difference, even when it doesn't feel like one."

Turns out the form they needed was something about confirming Tom's cause of death which. I had to say that out loud. \"My husband's cause of death.\" To a stranger. On the phone. At my kitchen table at 9am on a Tuesday.\n\nBut she said it's fixable. I need to get a copy from the funeral home and send it in and then it's just processing time. Maybe a month delay, not the forever I had built in my head. She even said \"this happens more often than you'd think, don't worry.\" Which. I don't know if that helped or made it worse. All these widows out there missing forms. A whole club I never wanted to join.\n\nSo that's. Not the disaster I thought. The house isn't disappearing. March is still tight but not impossible.\n\nWork is. I'm going. That's the best I can say right now. Janet asked if everything was okay after the bathroom thing last week and I said \"just adjusting\" which isn't technically a lie. She nodded and didn't push. Mark keeps giving me things to organize which I think means he trusts me or he just doesn't want to do it himself. Either way.\n\nBut I can't shake this feeling like I'm waiting for the next thing. The next email, the next form I didn't know existed, the next way Tom's death is going to reach up and grab me when I'm not ready. It's exhausting being braced all the time.\n\nBonnie figured out how to open the pantry door. Found her with an entire bag of treats. She didn't even look guilty. Just sat there chewing while I stood in the doorway like an idiot.\n\nI laughed again. Twice this week now. That's something right.",
      "assistant": "**The phone call:** Forty-five minutes on hold, and you stayed on. Then you had to say the words\u2014\"my husband's cause of death\"\u2014to a stranger named Patricia, at your kitchen table, at 9am on a Tuesday. That's a brutal sentence to have to speak out loud. And you did it anyway. You got the information. It's fixable. A form from the funeral home, some processing time, maybe a month delay. Not the forever your brain built at 3am. Not the house disappearing. Just paperwork, the kind that happens more often than you'd think, according to Patricia and all the other widows in the club you never wanted to join.\n\nYou said you don't know if \"this happens all the time\" helped or made it worse. I think it's both. There's something lonely about being one of many\u2014your specific grief reduced to a common administrative hiccup. But there's also something in knowing you're not uniquely broken, not the only one who missed a form while drowning. Other people sat at their kitchen tables saying impossible sentences to strangers named Patricia. They got through it. You're getting through it.\n\n**Work:** You're going. Janet asked, you said \"just adjusting,\" she didn't push. Mark keeps handing you things to organize\u2014either trust or delegation, and honestly, does it matter which? You're doing the work. You're showing up. Three weeks in and you haven't been walked to your car with a box. That's not nothing, even on the days when \"I'm going\" is the best you can say.\n\n**The bracing:** You named it exactly: exhausted from being braced all the time. Waiting for the next email, the next form, the next way Tom's death reaches up and grabs you when you're not ready. That's the thing about grief and logistics tangled together\u2014you can't finish grieving because the paperwork keeps coming, and you can't finish the paperwork because you're grieving while you do it. Every form is a tiny ambush. Every hold music is forty-five minutes of waiting to say something impossible.\n\nI don't think the bracing goes away completely. Not yet. There probably are more forms, more calls, more moments where you have to say his name to strangers who need documentation. But here's what's different now: you know you can make the call. You stayed on hold. You said the sentence. You got the answer. The next ambush will still be hard, but you have evidence now that you can survive it. That's not nothing. That's armor you didn't have before.\n\n**Bonnie and the pantry:** She figured out the door. Entire bag of treats. No guilt whatsoever. Just sitting there chewing while you stood in the doorway. And you laughed. Twice this week.\n\nThat's not just something. That's your nervous system remembering it can do something besides brace. You're not laughing because everything is fine. You're laughing because a ridiculous dog did a ridiculous thing and your body responded before your brain could get in the way. That's healing\u2014not the kind that erases the grief, but the kind that lets other things exist alongside it. The bracing and the laughing, both real, both this week.\n\nYou called the insurance company. You said the impossible sentence. You found out the disaster wasn't a disaster. You went to work. You laughed twice. Bonnie is a menace who has now added breaking and entering to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nYou're still here. Still braced, still tired, still waiting for the next grab. But also still laughing when a dog steals a bag of treats. Both things. Same week. That's where you are now."

      "user": "Something happened at work today and I can't stop thinking about it.\n\nSusan, the other woman in the office, she was talking about her mother who died last year and she started crying a little and I just. Froze. Didn't know what to do. Janet went over and put a hand on her shoulder and said something kind and I just sat there at my desk like a statue pretending to look at my computer.\n\nAnd then afterward I kept thinking why couldn't I do that. Why couldn't I be the one who went over. I know what it's like. I know exactly what it's like. But I couldn't move. Couldn't say anything. Just sat there being useless while someone else did the human thing.\n\nTom was good at that. Knowing what to say. Being the person who showed up for people. I just stand there frozen like something's broken in me.\n\nThen tonight I was making dinner and I dropped a glass and it shattered everywhere and I just. Stood in the kitchen with glass all around me and started crying. Not about the glass. About Susan and her mother and me not being able to move and Tom not being here and everything. All of it at once. Couldn't even tell you what I was crying about specifically. Just. Everything.\n\nBonnie stayed in the doorway like she knew not to come in with all the glass. Smart dog.\n\nThe pension check came. First real one. Deposited it this morning. That's good I guess. One less thing to worry about for now.\n\nBut I keep going back to Susan crying and me frozen and thinking maybe I'm just. Not someone who can be there for other people. Maybe I used up whatever that part of me was.",
      "assistant": "**Susan crying:** You watched her break down about her mother. Janet went over, put a hand on her shoulder, said something kind. And you froze. Sat there pretending to look at your computer, unable to move, unable to speak, knowing exactly what she was feeling and still not being able to reach toward her. You're asking why you couldn't be the one who went over. Why you couldn't do the human thing.\n\nHere's what I think happened: you knew too much. You weren't watching someone grieve from a safe distance\u2014you were watching someone live something you're still living. And your body, which has been in survival mode for almost a year now, did what it knows how to do: it protected you. It froze because moving toward her grief would have meant moving toward your own, right there in the office, in front of everyone. That's not broken. That's your nervous system trying to keep you upright when the room suddenly got dangerous.\n\nJanet could go over because Susan's grief isn't Janet's grief. She could offer comfort from the outside. You can't offer it from the outside\u2014you're inside the same thing. That makes it harder, not easier. It doesn't mean you're not someone who can be there for people. It means you're still in the middle of your own loss, and reaching toward someone else's is complicated in ways it wouldn't be for someone who isn't carrying what you're carrying.\n\n**The glass:** You dropped it, it shattered, and you stood there crying. Not about the glass\u2014about Susan and her mother and you not being able to move and Tom and everything, all of it at once, none of it separable. That's how grief works sometimes. It waits for a broken glass, a small moment of mess, and then everything comes through at once because there's finally a crack to come through.\n\nYou weren't crying about being clumsy. You were crying because you've been holding so much, and today something reminded you of how alone it can feel to be grieving in a room full of people who don't know, and then the glass broke and your body said *okay, now, here, this is when we let some of it out.* That's not falling apart. That's pressure releasing because it had to go somewhere.\n\nBonnie stayed in the doorway. She knew not to walk into the glass. Smart dog. Also: you noticed that, even while crying. You were still tracking her, still aware, still keeping her safe. Even in the middle of breaking down, part of you was still holding things together. That's not nothing.\n\n**The pension check:** First real one. Deposited this morning. One less thing. You're right\u2014that's good. The spreadsheet is a little less terrifying. March is a little less impossible. You did the paperwork, you made the calls, you survived the deadlines. The money is showing up now. Let that be what it is: one piece of ground under your feet.\n\n**\"Maybe I used up whatever that part of me was\":** The part that can be there for other people. You think maybe it's gone, spent, emptied out by everything you've been through. But I don't think you used it up. I think it's resting. It's been turned inward for almost a year, keeping you alive, getting you out of bed, making you eat, walking you into job interviews and insurance phone calls and all the impossible tasks of surviving. It hasn't had anything left over for reaching toward other people's pain because it's been too busy managing yours.\n\nThat won't be true forever. Someday\u2014maybe not soon, but someday\u2014you'll be in a room when someone breaks down, and your body will let you move. You'll say something small, or just sit next to them, or put your hand on their shoulder the way Janet did. It'll happen not because you forced it but because you'll finally have enough margin to extend past your own edges. You're not there yet. That's okay. You're still in the part where you need to receive more than you give. That's allowed. That's what this part is for.\n\nYou froze today. You cried tonight. You deposited a pension check this morning. Bonnie waited in the doorway while you fell apart and then probably demanded dinner anyway. All of it, the same day, the same you\u2014frozen and crying and functioning and loved by a dog who's too smart to walk on glass.\n\nYou're not broken. You're just still healing. Those look similar from the inside, but they're not the same thing."

      "user": "Talked to Susan today.\n\nDidn't plan it. She was in the break room making coffee and I just. Walked in and said \"I'm sorry about your mom. I lost my husband last year. I didn't know what to say the other day but I wanted you to know I understand.\"\n\nAnd then I just stood there like an idiot waiting to see what would happen. She got this look on her face and said \"I wondered if something like that had happened\" and then we just. Stood there. Two people who lost people. Drinking bad office coffee.\n\nShe asked how long and I said almost eleven months now and my voice did the thing but I didn't leave. She said \"it's the weirdest thing isn't it, being around people who don't know\" and I said yeah. That was it. Nothing profound. Just. Yeah.\n\nSo I guess I'm not completely empty. I guess that part isn't all used up.\n\nBut then I got home and the whole day just hit me and I was on the couch for four hours. Bonnie brought me her toy like she wanted to play and I couldn't even. Just lay there holding it while she stared at me. Eventually she gave up and fell asleep on my legs.\n\nThe money stuff. I should probably update you. The insurance form went through. Patricia called to confirm. The payout's coming next month. So that's. The safety net's actually there now. March isn't the cliff I thought it was.\n\nI keep waiting to feel relieved but mostly I just feel tired. Like I've been running from something for months and now it's not chasing me anymore but I forgot how to stop running.\n\nTom's birthday is next week. Would have been 59. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with that. Last year I spent it in bed. Maybe this year I. I don't know. I don't know what's better or worse or what any of it means.",
      "assistant": "**Talking to Susan:** You walked into the break room and said the thing. No plan, no script\u2014just \"I'm sorry about your mom. I lost my husband last year. I didn't know what to say the other day but I wanted you to know I understand.\" And then you stood there, waiting, not knowing what would happen. She didn't flinch. She said \"I wondered if something like that had happened.\" And then you just stood there together, two people who lost people, drinking bad coffee, saying nothing profound. Just *yeah*.\n\nThat's not nothing. That's you reaching toward someone else's grief when a week ago you froze at your desk. You said you guess you're not completely empty, that part isn't all used up. You're right. It wasn't gone\u2014it was just waiting until you had enough to spare. Today you had enough. Not a lot, not extra, just barely enough to say a few sentences and stand there. That's what healing looks like sometimes: not big gestures, just one person saying *I understand* and another person saying *yeah*.\n\n**The four hours on the couch:** You did a hard thing, and then you came home and collapsed. Bonnie brought her toy and you couldn't play, just lay there holding it while she stared and eventually gave up and slept on your legs. That's the cost of reaching toward someone when you're still this depleted. It took something out of you. The couch wasn't failure\u2014it was recovery. You spent something real in that break room, and your body needed to lie down afterward. Bonnie seemed to understand eventually. She adjusted. She stayed.\n\n**The insurance:** Patricia called. The form went through. The payout's coming next month. The safety net is real now. March isn't a cliff anymore. You said you keep waiting to feel relieved but mostly you just feel tired\u2014like you've been running from something for months and now it's not chasing you anymore but you forgot how to stop running.\n\nThat's exactly right. Your nervous system has been in threat mode since Tom died. The money fear was one of the loudest alarms, and it's been screaming for months: *March, the cliff, you'll lose everything*. Now the alarm is off, but your body doesn't trust the silence yet. It's still braced, still scanning, still waiting for the next emergency. Relief might come later, in pieces, when your system finally believes the danger passed. For now, tired makes sense. You've been surviving on adrenaline and fear. When that stops, exhaustion is what's left.\n\n**Tom's birthday:** Next week. Would have been 59. Last year you spent it in bed, and you're wondering what this year is supposed to look like. Whether there's a better or worse way to do it. What any of it means.\n\nI don't think there's a supposed to. Last year you were four months in, drowning, barely functional\u2014bed was what you could do. This year you're eleven months in, working, talking to coworkers about loss, depositing pension checks, keeping a dog alive. You're different. The day might be different too, or it might not. You might get through it upright, or you might need the bed again. Both are allowed.\n\nIf you want something to consider: is there one small thing that would feel like honoring him without demanding too much? Not a big gesture, not a performance of grief\u2014just something. The peaches he would have loved. A walk somewhere he liked. Saying his name out loud to Bonnie, just to hear it in the room. Or nothing at all. Just getting through. You get to decide what the day holds. There's no right answer. There's just you, and what you can carry, and whatever feels true when you wake up that morning.\n\nYou talked to Susan. You reached toward someone. You lay on the couch for four hours because it cost you something real. The money is coming. The cliff isn't a cliff. Tom's birthday is next week and you don't know what to do with it yet.\n\nThat's okay. You don't have to know yet. You just have to get there, the way you get everywhere now\u2014tired, unsure, with a dog on your legs and a little more proof that you're not as empty as you thought."
