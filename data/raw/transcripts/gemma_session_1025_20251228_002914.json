      "assistant": "**Your mom:** It sounds like you're in a tricky spot with your mom \u2013 wanting to connect but also feeling drained by her comments. That guilt and annoyance swirling together is really common when boundaries get blurred. One thing that might be helpful is to notice if you\u2019re taking responsibility for her feelings. It\u2019s natural to want her to be happy, but her reactions are ultimately her responsibility. What's one small thing you could say next time she brings up a visit, that feels honest but kind?\n\n**Work stress:** The uneven workload with your coworker \u2013 that's incredibly frustrating, especially when it feels like you're carrying the weight. Avoiding drama is understandable, but it\u2019s also valid to feel resentful. Perhaps you could try a brief, neutral check-in with your coworker: \"Hey, I'm feeling a bit overloaded with the project. Can we chat quickly about how we're dividing tasks?\" Does that feel doable, or would something else fit better?\n\n**Sleep:** You mentioned needing to get that out, and it sounds like a lot landed. It\u2019s okay to just feel the weight of it. What's one thing you're hoping for from our conversations moving forward?"

      "user": "so i did talk to my coworker actually. didnt go great lol. like i tried to be all nice about it and he basically was like \"oh yeah sure ill help more\" but then the next day he did the exact same thing. so now i feel stupid for even bringing it up\n\nmy mom called again yesterday and i just didnt answer. i know i should probably call her back but honestly i just cant deal with it rn. every time we talk its the same script and im tired\n\nbeen sleeping like crap too. keep waking up at 3am and then my brain just goes into overdrive thinking about all this stuff. work deadlines, my mom being mad at me, whether i should look for a new job. its exhausting\n\nanyway thats where im at. not great but whatever",
      "assistant": "**Coworker:** That\u2019s a tough spot\u2014you tried to address the issue, and it didn't lead to the change you hoped for. It's completely valid to feel a bit foolish or frustrated after that. My working guess is that he's not going to change unless he experiences a consequence for not pulling his weight. Could you track for the next few days how much extra work you're doing, just as data? This can help you see the full picture, and it might be useful if you need to escalate the issue with your manager.\n\n**Your mom:** Last time we talked about setting boundaries with your mom. You skipped the call, which is a boundary in itself. It's brave to protect your energy when interactions are consistently draining. Does it feel right to continue avoiding calls, or is there a way to set a more explicit boundary\u2014like, responding with a short text saying you're busy right now?\n\n**Sleep:** Waking up at 3am and the brain overload\u2014that sounds incredibly draining. It's like your brain is using that quiet time to rehearse all the worries. One thing you could try tonight is a \"brain dump\" before bed. Write down everything that's swirling around \u2013 deadlines, mom worries, job thoughts \u2013 then set it aside and tell yourself, \"I'll deal with this tomorrow.\" How does that sound?"

      "assistant": "**Sleep:** That\u2019s great news about falling back asleep\u2014even one less wake-up is a win. It sounds like the brain dump gave you a bit of a buffer. Did you notice any patterns in what you wrote down?\n\n**Work:** It's really frustrating to put in all the extra effort, especially when the credit is shared unfairly. It\u2019s valid to feel annoyed, and it sounds like your manager\u2019s compliment, while nice, also highlighted the imbalance. One thought - could you keep a log for a week of the tasks you and your coworker do? This could be helpful if you need to have a more direct conversation with your manager later.\n\n**Your mom:** That voicemail\u2014the \u201cworried about you\u201d line\u2014can really hit hard, especially when it\u2019s layered with the usual script. It sounds like your sister's advice, while well-meaning, isn\u2019t quite landing because she\u2019s not experiencing the same dynamic. Perhaps instead of a call, could you send her a text acknowledging her concern but setting a boundary? Something like, \"Hey Mom, I'm doing okay. I'm really busy right now, but I'll reach out when I have a moment.\"\n\n**Job search:** The pull to explore other options is completely understandable. The thought of job searching *does* sound exhausting, and it\u2019s okay to feel hesitant. What\u2019s one tiny step you could take toward exploring this\u2014maybe just browsing job listings for 15 minutes, or updating one section of your resume?"

It sounds like her communication style is pretty consistent, and those kinds of messages tend to trigger a response in you. I wonder, if you were advising a friend in this situation, what would you tell them about how to handle that pressure?\n\n**Work:** Great job starting that tracking log\u2014that\u2019s a really powerful step. It\u2019s about having the data to make informed decisions. You don\u2019t need to know *what* you\u2019ll do with it yet, just gathering the information. It's a solid foundation.\n\n**Job search:** It\u2019s completely valid to choose stability, especially when the thought of change feels overwhelming. The \"what if the next place is worse?\" question is a really smart one\u2014it\u2019s about weighing the risks and benefits. It sounds like you\u2019re leaning toward staying, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. Can you name one thing you *do* appreciate about your current job?\n\n**Sleep:** It\u2019s good to hear that sleep is generally okay, even with occasional wake-ups. That's progress. What\u2019s been different about the nights you\u2019ve been sleeping better?"

      "assistant": "**Your mom:** Wow, her showing up unannounced\u2014that takes the pressure up a notch. It's completely understandable that you felt overwhelmed and needed to set a boundary. It sounds like you managed to communicate your need for space, which is a big step, even if it was difficult. Feeling both terrible *and* relieved is a really common mix of emotions after setting a boundary, especially with a parent. It's a sign you're navigating a complex situation. Can you name one small thing that felt good about setting that boundary, even amidst the discomfort?\n\n**Work:** Glad to hear the deadline is over\u2014that must feel like a weight lifted. And that\u2019s wonderful about the improved sleep this week.\n\n**Your sister:** Your sister\u2019s reaction\u2014it\u2019s common for family members to react with concern when you set boundaries, even if they don\u2019t fully understand the situation. It sounds like you\u2019re second-guessing yourself a bit. But remember, you\u2019re not responsible for managing your mom's feelings or preventing her reactions. What\u2019s one thing you know to be true about your own needs in this situation, regardless of what your sister thinks?"

Responding on your own terms, even just a little bit, is significant progress. It's great that you're noticing that shift.\n\n**Job situation:** That\u2019s quite a twist with the team restructuring\u2014it\u2019s understandable to feel a mix of relief and uncertainty. It sounds like you're grappling with the \"should have/could have\" of job searching. It\u2019s easy to look back and think, \"If only I'd done X...\" But you made the choice that felt right for you at the time, based on what you knew then. What\u2019s one small, neutral thing you could do to prepare for working with these new team members\u2014maybe just check their LinkedIn profiles?\n\n**Overall:** \"Things are ok but also not really\" \u2013 that really captures the complexity of the situation. It\u2019s okay to sit with that ambiguity. What\u2019s one thing that\u2019s giving you a sense of grounding or stability right now\u2014something outside of work and family?"

      "user": "been thinking about what you asked and honestly the thing im most proud of is that people actually want to pay me for photos. like that still blows my mind\n\nanyway so the work reorganization happened and two people on my team got let go. wasnt anyone i work with directly but still feels bad. everyones kinda on edge now and im supposed to be the leader whos all calm and confident but inside im just like \"what if im next even though they said im safe\" lol\n\ndid all three photo shoots over the weekend though. one of them was for a couples engagement photos and they literally cried when i showed them the shots. felt really good but also made me think like. maybe this is what i should actually be doing instead of the corporate job thing. but thats probably stupid bc photography doesnt have benefits or stability or whatever\n\nalso my mom texted asking when im coming home again. told her maybe in a few weeks and she just said ok. no guilt trip, no passive aggressive stuff. honestly dont know what to do with this new normal version of her\n\nidk. lifes weird right now. good stuff and stressful stuff all mixed together",
