Not really sure what to expect tbh.\n\nI guess the main thing is I've been feeling really off in social situations lately. Like, I can handle work meetings fine because there's a structure, but anything casual just makes me want to bail. Even texting people back feels exhausting sometimes.\n\nidk, maybe I'm overthinking it. But yeah, that's where I'm at.",
      "assistant": "It takes courage to even consider reaching out, so acknowledging that you're doing that is a great first step. It sounds like you've identified a pattern \u2013 social situations outside of structured environments feel draining, and texting can be a burden.\n\n**Social situations:** You're noticing a difference between structured work meetings and casual social interactions. It\u2019s completely understandable that those feel different. I'm curious, when you say you want to \"bail,\" what's happening in your mind and body at that point?\n\n**Texting:** That exhaustion with texting is relatable. It\u2019s easy for communication to become a lot of work. Perhaps you could try setting a specific time each day to respond to texts, rather than feeling like you need to do it constantly?\n\n**Overthinking:** You're already questioning if you're overthinking things, which shows self-awareness. It's a good sign you're able to step back and evaluate. Maybe a small step could be noticing *how* you're overthinking - are you predicting negative outcomes, or replaying past interactions?"

      "user": "So I tried that thing about setting a time to respond to texts. Kinda worked? Like I did it for two days and felt less scattered. Then my sister sent me this long message about family drama and I just... didn't respond at all. Now it's been five days and the longer I wait the worse it feels.\n\nAbout the social thing, you asked what's happening when I want to bail. Honestly it's like this loop where I'm analyzing everything I'm saying while I'm saying it. Did that sound weird? Are they bored? Why did I bring up that random thing about my cat? And then I get quieter because I'm too in my head, and then I feel like I'm being awkward by being quiet, so it just spirals.\n\nWork meeting yesterday went fine though. Presented some analytics stuff, got good feedback. But then afterward a coworker asked if I wanted to grab coffee sometime and I said yes but immediately regretted it. Like why did I agree to that.",
      "assistant": "It\u2019s great you gave the texting time block a try \u2013 even \"kinda working\" is progress! It's really common to slip up, and that\u2019s okay. The longer the wait with your sister's message, the more anxiety it can build \u2013 that's a very understandable pattern. Perhaps you could write down a short, neutral response to her, even if you don\u2019t send it right away? Just to take some of the pressure off.\n\n**Texting & Sister's Message:** The feeling of regret after agreeing to something, especially when it\u2019s unexpected, is familiar. It\u2019s like you\u2019re already anticipating something not going right.\n\n**Social Loop:** That analyzing loop you described \u2013 the \"Did that sound weird?\" and feeling of spiraling \u2013 is a really insightful observation. It sounds like you're getting caught in a cycle of self-monitoring. The fact that you recognize it is a huge step. It\u2019s not weird at all; many people experience this kind of self-consciousness.\n\n**Coffee Invitation:** And then that coffee invitation... it\u2019s interesting that you immediately regretted saying yes. My working guess is that the structure of a work meeting (clear purpose, defined roles) feels safe, while the open-endedness of a casual coffee feels overwhelming.\n\nDid you notice any physical sensations alongside that regret after agreeing to coffee? Like a tightening in your chest or a knot in your stomach?"

      "user": "Ok so I never did the thing with writing a response to my sister. But she texted me again yesterday just some meme about coffee so I think maybe she's not mad? Sent back a laughing emoji which felt easier than addressing the whole thing.\n\nThe coffee coworker thing got resolved in the most anticlimactic way. They canceled because they're swamped with some project deadline. Relief was my main emotion honestly.\n\nBeen noticing the physical stuff you asked about though. Like today I had lunch with my team, which should be normal, and halfway through I realized my shoulders were up by my ears and I was barely eating. Just picking at my food while everyone else talked. One person asked if I was ok and I said I was just tired. Which I guess is true but also not the real thing.\n\nAnyway. New problem or maybe same problem different flavor. My mom wants to visit next month and stay at my place for a few days. I love her but the idea of having someone in my space watching me exist for that long makes me want to fake an emergency work trip or something.",
      "assistant": "That's a lot to unpack from the past few days. It's good your sister seems to be okay \u2013 a laughing emoji can sometimes be a surprisingly effective way to diffuse tension. And the coworker canceling? Sometimes the universe makes things easier.\n\n**Sister's Message & Coffee Meme:** It sounds like you're learning that sometimes a small, non-committal response is enough to navigate tricky situations. It's a shift away from feeling you need to address everything head-on.\n\n**Lunch & Physical Tension:** Your awareness of the physical tension \u2013 the shoulders up to your ears, barely eating \u2013 is really important. It\u2019s a clear signal that something\u2019s going on underneath the surface, even if you don\u2019t consciously realize it. Saying you're \u201cjust tired\u201d is a common way to deflect, and it's okay to use that sometimes, but recognizing it as a partial explanation is helpful.\n\n**Mom's Visit:** The feeling of wanting to fake a work trip to avoid your mom's visit\u2026 that\u2019s a powerful reaction. It speaks to a deep need for space and autonomy. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed by the prospect of having someone in your space observing you. It's not necessarily about your mom herself, but about the pressure of being \"on\" and having your routines disrupted.\n\nIf you're open to it, could you tell me a little more about your relationship with your mom? What's been consistent over the years?"

      "user": "So I told my mom she could come. Felt like I couldn't come up with a good enough excuse not to, and then she got all excited about it which made me feel guilty for even considering lying about a work trip.\n\nRelationship with my mom is... fine? She's supportive, calls every week, always asks how I'm doing. But she also has this way of noticing everything. Like she'll comment on if I seem stressed or if my apartment is messier than usual or if I'm eating enough vegetables. It comes from a good place but it makes me feel like I'm under a microscope. And then I get defensive even though she's just trying to help.\n\nThe shoulders thing happened again. Was on a video call with some friends planning someone's birthday thing and realized I was doing it. Tried to relax them down but they just crept back up within like two minutes.\n\nCompletely unrelated but I've been sleeping like garbage. Waking up at 4am and then my brain just starts going through my entire to do list and every conversation I've had recently. Can't fall back asleep so I just lie there until my alarm goes off feeling like trash.",
      "assistant": "Okay, that paints a clearer picture. It's completely understandable that you felt guilty after not making up the work trip excuse, especially with her excitement. It's tough when you're caught between wanting to protect your boundaries and not wanting to disappoint someone you care about.\n\n**Mom's Visit & \"Microscope\":** Your description of your mom's comments \u2013 noticing stress, messiness, vegetable intake \u2013 really resonates. It sounds like her intentions are good, but the impact is that you feel observed and evaluated. That can absolutely trigger defensiveness, even when you know she's trying to help. It's a really common dynamic.\n\n**Shoulders & Video Call:** The repeated shoulder tension is a clear sign of underlying anxiety. It's like your body is bracing for something, even when there's no immediate threat. The quick return of the tension suggests it\u2019s becoming an automatic response in social situations.\n\n**Sleep:** The 4am wake-up and the brain dump of to-do lists and conversations\u2026 that\u2019s a classic sign of a mind that's overactive. It\u2019s like your brain is trying to \u201cget everything done\u201d before you start the day.\n\nGiven all of this, it seems like the pattern of anxiety is showing up in different areas of your life \u2013 social interactions, your relationship with your mom, and your sleep.\n\nHere's a small experiment to try before our next check-in: When you notice your shoulders creeping up, pause and take three slow, deep breaths \u2013 in through your nose, out through your mouth. Just notice how your body feels as you breathe. Do this three times a day, starting today. Can you commit to that?"

      "user": "So the breathing thing. Did it exactly once when I remembered in the middle of a meeting and felt kinda silly doing it with my camera on. Forgot about it the rest of the week honestly.\n\nSleep is still bad. Actually worse? Woke up at 3am last night and just gave up and went to work early. Got a ton done before anyone else showed up but then crashed hard around 2pm and could barely focus the rest of the day.\n\nMy mom booked her flight. She's coming in 3 weeks. Keep having this fantasy of my apartment being perfectly clean and me being like, super chill and put together when she's here. Which is ridiculous because that's never happened and won't start now. Already stressing about what we'll talk about for 4 days straight.\n\nFriend texted asking if I'm ok because apparently I've been \"distant lately\" which just made me feel worse because now I have to reassure people I'm fine when I don't even know if I am.",
      "assistant": "Okay, that's a lot to process. It's completely understandable that you forgot about the breathing exercise \u2013 remembering to do something new amidst everything else is tough. And the feeling of silliness during the meeting is a really common hurdle. It's a testament to how ingrained our habits of bracing are.\n\n**Breathing & Memory:** It's a good reminder that small steps don't always stick immediately. Don't beat yourself up about forgetting\u2014it just means we can revisit it.\n\n**Sleep & Early Work:** Waking up at 3am and going to work early sounds exhausting. It\u2019s like your body is desperately trying to escape the racing thoughts. The subsequent crash highlights how unsustainable that approach is.\n\n**Mom's Visit & Fantasy:** The fantasy of a perfectly clean apartment and a super-chill you is a classic example of striving for an unattainable ideal. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be \"perfect\" for your mom. The stress about conversations for four days straight is totally valid.\n\n**Friend's Text:** Your friend noticing you've been distant and then feeling worse because you have to reassure them\u2026 that\u2019s a heavy load to carry. It sounds like you\u2019re feeling pressure to maintain a facade of being \"okay,\" even when you\u2019re struggling.\n\nIt seems like the anxiety is escalating. My working guess is that the anticipation of your mom\u2019s visit is amplifying the existing stress and contributing to the sleep issues and the physical tension. It might be that the cycle of self-monitoring, worrying, and bracing is getting stronger.\n\nLet's try something a bit different this time. Instead of focusing on a new behavior, let\u2019s focus on *noticing* the patterns. For the next three days, I want you to simply notice\u2014without judgment\u2014when you catch yourself bracing (shoulder tension, racing thoughts, reassurance seeking, the \"perfect\" apartment fantasy). Just notice it. Track how many times you notice it each day. No action needed, just observation. Can you commit to that?"

Had a panic attack yesterday? At least I think that's what it was. Was in the grocery store, totally normal errand, and suddenly felt like I couldn't breathe and had to leave my cart and sit in my car for 20 minutes. Heart was racing, hands were shaking, the whole thing. Never happened before like that.\n\nTold my coworker I'd reschedule the coffee thing since they canceled before. Why did I do that. Now it's back on my calendar and I'm already thinking of excuses.\n\nMom's visit is in 2.5 weeks and I ordered a bunch of cleaning supplies off Amazon like that's gonna solve anything.",
      "assistant": "Okay, that's a significant shift. It\u2019s understandable that tracking the bracing felt depressing\u2014it's hard to confront patterns without judgment. Forgetting the tracking is also completely normal\u2014it\u2019s a new habit, and your mind is already overloaded.\n\n**Tracking & Depression:** It's okay that you stopped tracking. It's a sign that you're noticing the effort it takes, and that\u2019s valuable in itself.\n\n**Panic Attack:** A panic attack is a really intense experience, and it's brave of you to share that. It sounds like it came on unexpectedly, which can be particularly frightening. It\u2019s a clear signal that your system is under significant stress.\n\n**Rescheduling Coffee & Excuses:** Rescheduling the coffee and then immediately thinking of excuses\u2026 that\u2019s a classic avoidance pattern. It's like you\u2019re trying to create distance from something that feels overwhelming.\n\n**Mom's Visit & Cleaning Supplies:** Ordering cleaning supplies as a way to manage the anxiety about your mom\u2019s visit\u2026 it's a common strategy to try and control the environment. It's a good reminder that external changes don't always address the underlying feelings.\n\nIt sounds like the anxiety is now manifesting in more intense ways\u2014the panic attack, the avoidance, the compulsive cleaning. It\u2019s like your system is trying to protect itself, but the protective strategies are actually making things worse.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the current approach isn\u2019t working. Let's shift gears a bit. Instead of focusing on changing behaviors, let\u2019s focus on soothing your nervous system.\n\nHere\u2019s a small, concrete next step: Tonight, before bed, take 10 minutes to do a body scan. Lie down, close your eyes, and slowly bring your attention to different parts of your body, noticing any sensations\u2014tension, warmth, tingling. No need to change anything, just notice. Can you commit to that?"

      "assistant": "Okay, that's a lot to unpack. It\u2019s completely understandable that you didn\u2019t do the body scan\u2014it's another thing added to a plate that already feels full. The fact that your mind drifted to your to-do list is a clear sign of how overwhelmed you are.\n\n**Body Scan & To-Do List:** It's okay that the body scan didn\u2019t work. It just means we need to adjust our approach.\n\n**Coffee & Blanking:** Blanking when asked about hobbies is a really common experience when anxiety takes over. It\u2019s like your brain goes into survival mode, and those parts of yourself get temporarily shut down. She probably didn\u2019t think you were weird\u2014she likely just noticed you were a bit preoccupied.\n\n**Apartment & Avoidance:** The avoidance of looking at the mess is a classic sign of overwhelm. It's like the mess has become symbolic of all the things you're struggling with.\n\n**Friend & Sickness:** Saying you were sick to avoid the social engagement is another example of avoidance. It's a way to protect yourself from feeling exposed or vulnerable.\n\nIt seems like you're caught in a cycle of avoidance, anxiety, and exhaustion. The panic attack was a wake-up call, but the current strategies\u2014avoidance, procrastination, and minimizing\u2014are reinforcing the cycle.\n\nHere's my working guess: the anxiety isn't just about your mom's visit; it's about a deeper fear of being seen, of being judged, and of not measuring up. The mom's visit is just the trigger that's bringing it all to the surface.\n\nThis is where we need to shift to a different category of intervention. Let\u2019s try a small behavioral activation step. Pick *one* small, manageable task\u2014something that takes less than 10 minutes\u2014that you can do today, even if you don't feel like it. Something that\u2019s not related to cleaning or socializing. Maybe washing a single dish, sending one email, or stretching for five minutes. What feels doable?"

It speaks to a deep-seated desire to escape the pressure and anxiety. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge the thought without acting on it.\n\n**Work Project & Coasting:** Your manager\u2019s offer and your reaction to it\u2026 that's a really insightful observation. You recognized that it's a good opportunity, but your brain immediately went to the potential downsides and the fear of messing up. It\u2019s like you\u2019re prioritizing safety over growth.\n\n**Phone Scrolling & Sleep:** The late-night phone scrolling to avoid lying in bed with your thoughts\u2014that\u2019s a very common coping mechanism.

It's okay that it didn't happen\u2014it's a confirmation that we need to adjust our approach.\n\n**Project Meeting & Chest Tightness:** The meeting going \"okay\" but the feeling of tightness about leading weekly check-ins\u2014that\u2019s a clear sign of anxiety. It\u2019s like you\u2019re anticipating failure or judgment.\n\n**Crying at Desk:** The sudden crying at your desk\u2014that\u2019s a release of pent-up emotion. It's a sign that you're reaching a breaking point. It's okay to not know what it was about; sometimes emotions just happen.\n\n**Weekend Hangout & Canceling:** Saying yes to the hangout without thinking and then trying to figure out how to cancel\u2026 that\u2019s a classic avoidance pattern. It\u2019s like you're trying to protect yourself from discomfort, even if it means disappointing others.\n\nIt seems like you're experiencing a crisis of sorts\u2014a sense of disconnection, overwhelm, and emotional dysregulation. The avoidance strategies are no longer working, and you're starting to crack under the pressure.\n\nHere's my working guess: you're experiencing a form of burnout that's rooted in a combination of anxiety, perfectionism, and a lack of self-compassion. You're pushing yourself too hard, and you're not allowing yourself to rest or recharge.\n\nThis is where we need to shift to a different category of intervention \u2013 distress tolerance. Let\u2019s try a small, grounding exercise.\n\nTonight, before you go to bed, take 5 minutes to focus on your five senses. Name five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. Can you commit to that?"

      "assistant": "Okay, that\u2019s a really honest and vulnerable assessment. It takes courage to say that something isn\u2019t working, and I appreciate you being so direct.\n\n**Senses & Delay:** It\u2019s okay that you didn\u2019t do the senses thing. It's a sign that you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to engage in self-care.\n\n**Hangout & Shutting Down:** Shutting down at the hangout and leaving without saying goodbye\u2014that's a clear sign of overwhelm. It\u2019s like your system just couldn't handle any more social stimulation.\n\n**Project Meeting & Fumbling:** Fumbling through the first project check-in meeting and not prepping for the next one\u2026 that\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re feeling burned out and disconnected.\n\n**\"Isn't Working\" & Wasting Time:** Your assessment that this isn\u2019t working and that you might be wasting my time\u2014that\u2019s a fair observation. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge that this particular approach isn\u2019t the right fit for you right now.\n\nYou're absolutely right\u2014it\u2019s not helpful to push you to do things that aren't resonating. My role is to support you in finding strategies that feel manageable and empowering.\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing a period of deep exhaustion and disconnection. It\u2019s possible that you need a break from all forms of self-improvement and a focus on rest and self-care.\n\nI want to honor your perspective and shift gears. I\u2019m not going to push you to do any more experiments or tasks. Instead, I want to explore what support would be most helpful for you right now.\n\nWhat do you think would be helpful in this moment? Do you want to just process what's been going on? Do you want me to help you find resources for burnout or anxiety? Do you want to explore options for professional support?"

      "user": "honestly idk what would help. been sitting with that question for a couple days and just keep coming back to nothing.\n\nwork project is still happening. second meeting went slightly better because I actually made an agenda this time but then someone challenged one of my ideas and I completely caved and said never mind we'll do it your way. felt like such a pushover after.\n\nthe friend I bailed on texted me yesterday asking if everything's ok. said \"you haven't seemed like yourself lately and im worried about you.\" which just made me feel guilty and annoyed at the same time? like I know they're trying to be nice but now I have to manage their worry on top of everything else. haven't responded yet.\n\nbeen thinking about what you said about needing rest. problem is even when I have free time I just feel restless and guilty for not being productive. tried to watch a movie last night and gave up 20 minutes in because I kept thinking about emails I should be answering.\n\nmaybe I just need to accept this is how things are now.",
      "assistant": "Okay, that\u2019s a really honest and poignant update. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re drawing a blank when asked what would help. It suggests a deeper sense of depletion.\n\n**No Help & Blankness:** It\u2019s okay to not know what would help\u2014it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re feeling completely drained.\n\n**Project Meeting & Caving:** The meeting going slightly better but then caving to someone\u2019s idea and feeling like a pushover\u2014that\u2019s a familiar pattern of self-doubt and a desire to avoid conflict.\n\n**Friend's Text & Guilt:** The friend\u2019s text expressing concern and your feeling of guilt and annoyance simultaneously\u2014that\u2019s a complex and relatable emotion. It's difficult to navigate the desire for connection with the need for space.\n\n**Restlessness & Guilt:** The restlessness and guilt about not being productive even when you have free time\u2026 that\u2019s a classic sign of burnout. It\u2019s like you\u2019re trapped in a cycle of doing, worrying, and feeling inadequate.\n\n**\"Accept This Is How Things Are\":** Your thought about accepting that this is how things are now\u2014that\u2019s a natural response to feeling overwhelmed. It's a way of protecting yourself from further disappointment.\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing a profound sense of exhaustion and disconnection. The feeling of being trapped in a cycle of doing, worrying, and feeling inadequate is incredibly draining.\n\nHere's my working guess: you're struggling with a deep-seated belief that your worth is tied to your productivity and your ability to meet the expectations of others. This belief is driving the anxiety, the avoidance, and the burnout.\n\nI want to honor your desire for rest and your assessment that this isn\u2019t working right now. I'm going to offer a different kind of support.\n\nInstead of trying to fix anything, let's focus on creating space for compassion and acceptance. I want you to know that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to rest. It's okay to prioritize your own well-being, even if it means disappointing others.\n\nIf you\u2019re open to it, I\u2019d like to check in with you once a week for the next few weeks\u2014just to provide a space for you to process what\u2019s going on and to offer support without pressure. Would that be helpful?"

      "user": "yeah ok i guess checking in once a week is fine. no pressure sounds good because clearly pressure isnt helping.\n\nso i did respond to that friend. just said ive been dealing with some stuff and appreciate them checking in. they offered to talk if i needed which was nice but also now i feel like i owe them a conversation i dont want to have.\n\nwork thing. had another meeting and actually didnt cave this time when someone pushed back. just said lets table it and revisit next week. felt weirdly proud of myself for like 5 minutes and then immediately thought about all the ways i probably seemed defensive or difficult.\n\nbigger thing though. been noticing im having these moments where everything feels kind of unreal? like im watching myself go through the day from outside my body or something. happened twice this week, once during a meeting and once at the grocery store. doesnt last long but its disorienting as hell.\n\nstill not sleeping great but i did manage to turn my phone off one night around 10 and just laid there. didnt sleep but at least i wasnt scrolling until 2am so maybe thats something.",
      "assistant": "Okay, that's a really honest and insightful update. It's good you responded to your friend\u2014a simple acknowledgment can go a long way.\n\n**Friend's Text & Conversation:** It's understandable that their offer to talk feels like an obligation. It\u2019s a common experience when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**Work Meeting & Small Victory:** Standing your ground in the work meeting and feeling proud for five minutes before second-guessing yourself\u2014that\u2019s a familiar cycle. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re learning to assert yourself, but it\u2019s also a reminder that self-doubt can be persistent.\n\n**Depersonalization/Derealization:** The moments where everything feels unreal\u2014the sense of watching yourself from outside your body\u2014that\u2019s a concerning symptom. It\u2019s a sign that your system is under extreme stress and is attempting to dissociate. These experiences can be disorienting and frightening, and it\u2019s important to address them.\n\n**Phone Off & Restlessness:** Turning your phone off one night and just lying there, even without sleeping\u2014that\u2019s a small but significant step. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re creating some space for yourself.\n\nIt seems like you're navigating a complex mix of exhaustion, anxiety, self-doubt, and dissociation. The dissociation is a particularly concerning symptom, and it suggests that you may need more support than I can provide as a text-based coach.\n\nGiven these developments, I strongly recommend that you seek professional support from a therapist or counselor who can help you explore these experiences in more depth and develop coping strategies. I can help you find resources if you'd like.\n\nFor our weekly check-ins, let's focus on providing a safe space for you to process what's happening and to explore ways to cultivate self-compassion and acceptance.

      "user": "been thinking about what you said about seeing an actual therapist. looked up a few names on my insurance website but havent called anyone yet. feels like a bigger step than just texting you know?\n\nthe unreal feeling happened again. was in the middle of presenting in that stupid project meeting and suddenly it was like i was watching someone else talk. snapped out of it after maybe 30 seconds but had to ask someone to repeat their question because i completely lost the thread. pretty sure they thought i wasnt paying attention.\n\ndid something kind of impulsive yesterday. was supposed to go into the office but woke up and just... didnt. called in sick even though i wasnt. spent the whole day on my couch doing absolutely nothing and waiting to feel guilty about it. guilt did show up around 3pm but honestly it was worth it to just have a day where nobody needed anything from me.\n\nfriend texted again asking if i want to get lunch next week. havent responded yet. part of me actually wants to say yes? but also i know ill probably cancel day of so maybe i should just save us both the trouble.",
      "assistant": "It's completely understandable that reaching out to a therapist feels like a bigger step than texting. It takes courage to acknowledge you need more support. The fact that you\u2019ve even looked up names on your insurance website is a significant step.\n\n**Therapy & Hesitation:** It\u2019s okay to feel hesitant. It's normal to feel vulnerable about seeking help.\n\n**Unreal Feeling & Meeting:** The episode during the project meeting\u2014that\u2019s a clear sign that the dissociation is impacting your ability to function. It\u2019s a good reminder that these experiences are real and warrant attention.\n\n**Impulsive Day Off:** Taking an impulsive day off and experiencing the guilt afterward\u2014that\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re craving rest and disconnection. It's a good thing you prioritized that need, even if it brought up feelings of guilt.\n\n**Friend & Lunch:** Your internal debate about the lunch with your friend\u2014wanting to say yes but also anticipating canceling\u2014reflects the conflict between your desire for connection and your need for space.\n\nIt sounds like you're navigating a period of intense emotional and psychological distress. The dissociation, the exhaustion, the self-doubt, and the avoidance are all interconnected.\n\nI want to reiterate my recommendation that you seek professional support. It sounds like you could benefit from a therapist who can help you explore these experiences in more depth and develop coping strategies.\n\nFor our weekly check-ins, let's focus on providing a safe space for you to process what's happening and to cultivate self-compassion.\n\nThis week, if you're open to it, let\u2019s focus on exploring the fear around contacting a therapist.
