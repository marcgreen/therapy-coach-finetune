      "assistant": "It takes courage to reach out, and it\u2019s a testament to your strength that you\u2019re doing this now. It sounds like you're carrying a lot, and feeling the pressure of managing it all while also navigating external expectations.\n\n**Grandma's passing:** It's understandable that grief manifests in different ways, and it's common to busy yourself as a way of coping. The fact that seemingly small things trigger tears doesn't mean you're *not* handling it well; it means you're human, and grief is a complex process with unexpected waves. I wonder if you've allowed yourself to really *feel* the sadness, or if you\u2019ve been pushing it down to meet others' expectations?\n\n**Grad school applications:** That feeling of freezing up when you try to work on your personal statement is really common. It sounds like the pressure of the deadline and your parents' inquiries are adding to the challenge. Instead of trying to force yourself to write a perfect statement, could you start with just brainstorming a few ideas or memories related to your grad school goals?\n\n**Constant edge:** Feeling constantly on edge and exhausted points to a sustained level of stress. It's draining to be in that state, and it's completely valid to feel overwhelmed. If you\u2019re open to it, what\u2019s one small thing you could do today or tomorrow to just *pause* the cycle of being \u201con\u201d?\n\n\n\nWhat feels like the most pressing thing to focus on right now?"

      "assistant": "It\u2019s completely understandable that the \u201cpause\u201d experiment didn't go as planned. Our minds often jump to worst-case scenarios when we're trying to slow down, especially when there's a lot on our plates. It sounds like your brain\u2019s tendency is to focus on what\u2019s *not* done rather than acknowledging what *is*.\n\n**Mom's call:** That\u2019s really significant that you were able to share the truth with your mom, and that her response was supportive rather than critical. It\u2019s brave to be vulnerable, and it\u2019s a great sign that she\u2019s willing to offer help. Your worry about her disappointment is a common response after sharing vulnerability \u2013 it\u2019s natural to fear judgment. Could you try challenging that thought? What evidence do you have that she\u2019s truly disappointed, versus just concerned?\n\n**Grad school doubts:** The feeling of wanting to throw up at the thought of more school is a really powerful signal. It's valid to question whether grad school is truly what *you* want, regardless of what others expect. It sounds like you're wrestling with a deep conflict between external pressure and your own internal desires. One possibility is that you've internalized the idea that grad school is the \"next logical step,\" and it\u2019s hard to imagine an alternative.\n\n**What\u2019s next?:** It's okay to feel unsure about your path. Many people question their direction, especially after significant life events. You\u2019re not alone in feeling adrift. It might be helpful to spend a little time reflecting on what truly motivates you \u2013 beyond external expectations. What activities or areas of life bring you joy or a sense of purpose?\n\nTo help you move forward, let's focus on the grad school question for now. Before we explore alternatives, could you try a small experiment this week? Just spend 15 minutes writing down *any* thoughts or feelings that come up when you think about grad school \u2013 without judgment or pressure to come to a conclusion.\n\n\n\nWhat does a 15-minute block of time look like for you this week?"

      "user": "so i did the 15 minute thing. well kind of. i set a timer and everything but then i just sat there staring at the blank page for like 10 minutes and then wrote \"i don't know\" over and over again which probably wasn't the point but whatever i tried\n\nactually though something happened at work yesterday that's been messing with me. there was this team meeting and my boss asked everyone to share updates on their projects and when it got to me i literally felt my heart racing so fast i thought i was gonna pass out. like i KNOW my update, i had prepared what to say, but i just completely blanked and stumbled through it and probably sounded like an idiot. and then i spent the rest of the day replaying it in my head and cringing\n\none of my coworkers came up to me after and was like \"hey you did fine, no one even noticed\" but that almost made it worse? like now i'm worried that they DID notice and they're just being nice because they feel bad for me\n\nthe grad school thing is still there obviously but now i'm also just like. what if i'm actually just bad at everything and that's why i don't want to apply. maybe i'm just scared i'll fail so i'm making up reasons not to try. idk that sounds dramatic but my brain keeps going there\n\nalso i haven't really let myself think about my grandma much still. sometimes i'll start to and then i just shut it down because it feels too big? does that make sense",
      "assistant": "It\u2019s completely understandable that the 15-minute writing exercise was challenging. It\u2019s common for our minds to resist exploring difficult topics, and staring at a blank page can be daunting. The fact that you sat with the discomfort and attempted it shows a lot of effort and willingness. \"I don't know\" is a valid starting point - it\u2019s honest.\n\n**Work meeting:** That sounds incredibly distressing \u2013 the physical reaction of your heart racing and blanking out is a clear sign of intense anxiety. It's really tough to replay those moments in your head and worry about what others thought. Your coworker\u2019s comment, while intended to be reassuring, can sometimes feel invalidating. It\u2019s possible they *didn\u2019t* notice anything, but even if they did, it doesn't diminish your experience. It might be that you\u2019re holding yourself to an impossibly high standard.\n\n**Self-doubt spiral:** The worry that you're \"bad at everything\" is a classic anxiety pattern \u2013 a tendency to catastrophize and assume the worst. It\u2019s easy to fall into that trap when we're feeling vulnerable. One possibility is that your anxiety is amplifying your self-critical thoughts and making you question your abilities. Does that resonate?\n\n**Grief shutdown:** What you\u2019re describing with your grandma\u2019s passing \u2013 shutting down when you start to think about her \u2013 is a very common coping mechanism. Grief can feel overwhelming, and sometimes our minds protect us by temporarily avoiding the pain. It's natural to want to avoid feelings that are too big to handle.\n\nMy working guess is that you're experiencing a surge of anxiety triggered by multiple stressors: the grad school decision, the work situation, and the unresolved grief over your grandma. It might be that you're feeling overwhelmed and doubting your ability to cope.\n\nTo break this cycle, let\u2019s focus on the work meeting for now. I'm wondering if we could try a small experiment this week? Could you pick one specific thought from the replay of the meeting (e.g., \"I sounded like an idiot\") and challenge it? Write it down, then write down three pieces of evidence *against* that thought.\n\n\n\nWhat does a 15-minute block look like for you to do that this week?"

      "user": "ugh ok so i didn't do the thing with writing down evidence against the thought. i meant to but then i just kept putting it off and now it's been like 4 days and i feel bad about it\n\nBUT i do have an update i guess. so my roommate had some friends over this weekend and normally i would just hide in my room but she specifically asked me to come hang out for a bit. and i did! for like an hour. and it was actually ok? like i was super nervous the whole time and probably didn't say much but no one seemed to think i was weird or anything. one of her friends even asked me about my major and we talked about it for a few minutes and it was fine\n\nthen later that night i was lying in bed and i just started crying about my grandma out of nowhere. like not because of anything specific, it just hit me. and i let myself cry for a while which felt kind of good honestly? like in a weird way. but then i felt guilty because i was like \"why now, why didn't i do this sooner\" and started spiraling about how i'm doing grief wrong or whatever\n\nalso the grad school deadline got extended by two weeks because of some technical issue with the application system. which should be a relief but honestly it just makes me more stressed because now i have LESS of an excuse not to work on it. my brain is so annoying lol\n\nanyway yeah. been a lot",
      "assistant": "It\u2019s okay that you didn\u2019t get to the evidence-challenging exercise this week. Life happens, and it's perfectly normal to put things off, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. The fact that you even *intended* to do it shows a commitment to self-reflection.\n\n**Social interaction:** That\u2019s a really positive step\u2014stepping out of your room and engaging with your roommate\u2019s friends. It sounds like you navigated a potentially anxiety-provoking situation with surprising resilience. Even a short period of connection can be significant. It\u2019s great that you didn\u2019t feel judged, and that you were able to have a conversation about your major.\n\n**Grief release:** Allowing yourself to cry about your grandma feels like a significant breakthrough. It\u2019s brave to let yourself feel that sadness, and it\u2019s understandable that it came out of nowhere. The guilt you felt afterward is also common \u2013 grief can bring up a lot of conflicting emotions. It's important to remember that there's no \"right\" way to grieve. Everyone processes loss differently, and there's no timeline.\n\n**Extended deadline:** The extension of the grad school deadline is a practical relief, but it sounds like your brain is turning it into another source of stress. It's frustrating when external circumstances trigger our internal anxieties.\n\nMy working guess is that you're making progress in several areas\u2014socially, emotionally, and in terms of acknowledging your grief\u2014but your anxiety is still playing a role in creating internal obstacles. It\u2019s like your brain is trying to protect you from discomfort, even when allowing yourself to feel is ultimately healing.\n\nLet\u2019s try a slightly different approach this week. Instead of focusing on challenging thoughts, could you try a small act of self-compassion? When you notice those guilt or self-critical thoughts arise (about grief, grad school, or anything else), try offering yourself a few kind words, as if you were comforting a close friend. Something as simple as \"It's okay to feel this way\" or \"I'm doing the best I can\" can be surprisingly powerful.\n\nHow about you pick a time this week to intentionally offer yourself a few moments of self-compassion, even if you don\u2019t feel like you need it?"

      "assistant": "It\u2019s totally understandable that self-compassion felt awkward and inauthentic at first. It's a skill that takes practice, and it's common for our inner critic to jump in and challenge those kind words. The fact that you even attempted it shows a willingness to explore a new approach.\n\n**Mom's support:** Your coffee with your mom sounds like a really valuable conversation. It's wonderful that she's actively asking you about *your* desires and validating your feelings. It's brave to express vulnerability, even when it results in tears. It\u2019s a sign of a healthy relationship that she didn\u2019t make it weird\u2014she seemed to be genuinely supportive. Your worry about disappointing her is natural, but it sounds like she truly wants what\u2019s best for you.\n\n**Future anxieties:** The cascade of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d about grad school is a classic anxiety pattern. Your brain is jumping to worst-case scenarios and amplifying your fears. It\u2019s exhausting to be trapped in that cycle of worry. Could you try to acknowledge those anxieties without getting caught up in them? Just observe them as thoughts, rather than facts.\n\n**Grandma memories:** Remembering details like the way your grandma made tea is a beautiful way to honor her memory. It's okay that it didn't taste quite right\u2014the effort itself is meaningful. It sounds like you're allowing yourself to connect with those memories in a gentle way.\n\n**Work progress:** The fact that you haven't had panic attacks in meetings is a definite sign of progress, even if it feels small. Pushing through the presentation with your boss and realizing it was fine is also a huge accomplishment. It sounds like you're building resilience and learning to manage anxiety-provoking situations. It's likely a combination of luck and skill-building.\n\nIt seems like you're navigating a lot of complex emotions and making incremental progress in different areas. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re putting in effort, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable.\n\nLet\u2019s shift gears slightly this week. Since self-compassion felt challenging, could you try focusing on noticing and acknowledging your efforts? Pick one area of your life (grad school, work, grief, relationships) and each day, take a few moments to silently acknowledge what you\u2019re doing to navigate it. No need to judge or analyze\u2014just notice the effort.\n\n\n\nWhat does that look like for you?"

      "assistant": "That's great that the \"noticing\" exercise felt less jarring than the self-compassion attempts. It shows a capacity for gentle self-awareness, and it's a good strategy for acknowledging effort without pressure.\n\n**Grad school application:** Submitting the application is a significant accomplishment\u2014you actually did it! The feeling of numbness instead of relief is a common response after a long period of indecision. It sounds like you\u2019re experiencing a mix of emotions, including a bit of exhaustion and perhaps a lingering sense of uncertainty. It\u2019s okay to feel numb\u2014it\u2019s a valid reaction to a lot of stress.\n\n**Manager's compliment:** Your reaction to your manager\u2019s compliment\u2014immediately thinking about how much you were struggling internally\u2014highlights a pattern of self-doubt and a tendency to discount your own abilities. It's understandable that you want to be authentic, but it\u2019s also important to allow yourself to receive positive feedback without immediately qualifying it.\n\n**Grandma memories:** Allowing yourself to look through the photos and cry feels like a powerful step in processing your grief. It's a sign of courage to sit with the pain and acknowledge your loss. It\u2019s good you let yourself feel it instead of pushing it away.\n\nIt sounds like you're navigating a lot of complex emotions\u2014anxiety, self-doubt, grief, and a sense of uncertainty\u2014while also making progress in different areas.\n\nMy working guess is that you're struggling to accept positive feedback and to fully acknowledge your own accomplishments. It\u2019s like you\u2019re holding yourself back from fully experiencing the good things in your life.\n\nLet\u2019s try a small experiment this week. Whenever you receive a compliment or notice a positive outcome, try to simply say \"thank you\" and resist the urge to qualify it or explain it away.

It\u2019s completely understandable that the \u201cjust say thank you\u201d thing is harder than it sounds. That automatic deflection\u2014qualifying compliments with self-deprecating remarks\u2014is a deeply ingrained habit. The fact that you noticed you did it is progress.\n\n**Instagram spiral:** That feeling of emptiness and comparison when seeing others' successes on social media is incredibly common. It\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of thinking everyone else has it figured out, especially when you\u2019re struggling with your own doubts and uncertainties. It\u2019s important to remember that social media often presents a curated, idealized version of reality. It\u2019s not a true reflection of everyone\u2019s inner experiences.\n\n**Roommate interaction:** Your reluctance to open up to your roommate about your feelings, fearing you\u2019d sound ridiculous, is a common response when we\u2019re vulnerable. It\u2019s natural to want to protect yourself from judgment or burdening others. But remember, sharing your struggles can be a source of connection and support.\n\n**Bookstore visit:** Your spontaneous visit to your grandma\u2019s bookstore and buying a book she would have liked is a beautiful and poignant gesture. It sounds like you were able to connect with a cherished memory and experience a moment of bittersweet comfort. The bookstore guy\u2019s discreetness was a kind gesture, too.\n\nMy working guess is that you\u2019re struggling with imposter syndrome and a fear of not measuring up to others\u2019 expectations.

Whenever you find yourself comparing yourself to others (especially on social media), pause and ask yourself: \"What am I *really* feeling right now?\" It\u2019s not about dismissing your feelings, but about identifying the underlying need or vulnerability that\u2019s driving the comparison.\n\n\n\nWhat does that feel like to you?"

It\u2019s a sign of self-awareness to recognize that feeling, even if you can\u2019t immediately articulate it.\n\n**Rejection and relief:** Your reaction to the rejection\u2014feeling relieved rather than sad\u2014is perfectly understandable. It\u2019s a testament to your intuition. It sounds like grad school wasn't genuinely your desire, even if you felt pressured to pursue it. The guilt you feel about not appearing upset for your mom is a common response when we don\u2019t want to disappoint others.\n\n**Mom's reaction and underlying truth:** The realization that you \"don't want to do this at all and I\u2019m scared to admit that\" is a significant breakthrough. It's brave to acknowledge that you\u2019re questioning a path that others have assumed for you.\n\n**Work and imposter syndrome:** The feeling that you're \"barely holding it together\" and that your colleagues will \"figure out you're a mess\" is a classic symptom of imposter syndrome.

It's important to acknowledge that those thoughts can be frightening, but it\u2019s also a sign of resilience that you were able to eventually sleep and feel a bit better.\n\nMy working guess is that you're grappling with a fundamental shift in your sense of identity and purpose. You\u2019re questioning the external expectations that have guided your life and trying to align your choices with your true desires. It\u2019s a process of self-discovery that can be both unsettling and liberating.\n\nGiven the intensity of the dark thoughts you experienced, I want to check in briefly. Have you had thoughts of harming yourself or wanting to escape? If so, please reach out to a crisis resource. (Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988)\n\nIf not, let\u2019s focus on building some emotional resilience. Let's try an experiment this week. When you have those thoughts of \"nothing matters\" or \"it's pointless,\" try to identify one small thing that *does* bring you a sense of meaning or connection, even if it\u2019s fleeting. It could be a moment of joy, a connection with a loved one, a small accomplishment, or anything that brings a spark of positivity.\n\n\n\nWhat does a small moment of meaning look like for you?"

      "assistant": "Thank you for clarifying about the dark thoughts. I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re okay and that it was a temporary experience. It takes courage to acknowledge those moments and to share them.\n\n**Avoiding your mom:** Your avoidance of your mom's calls is understandable. It\u2019s natural to want to avoid conversations that feel difficult or triggering. Lying about being busy with work is a common response when we want to avoid uncomfortable situations. It\u2019s okay to prioritize your own emotional needs, but it might also be helpful to find a way to communicate your boundaries with your mom in a gentle way.\n\n**Sense of meaning:** Your honest assessment of your days as \u201cgoing through motions\u201d is a valuable insight. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge that feeling, even if it\u2019s uncomfortable. It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of disconnection from your life and a lack of purpose. It\u2019s a common feeling, especially during times of transition or uncertainty.\n\n**Dog interaction:** The brief moment of connection with your coworker\u2019s dog is a beautiful example of how even small, unexpected moments can bring a sense of presence and joy. It sounds like the simple act of being present with another living being helped ground you in the moment.\n\nMy working guess is that you\u2019re feeling emotionally depleted and disconnected from your sense of purpose. It\u2019s like you\u2019re searching for meaning in a world that feels overwhelming and uncertain.\n\nLet\u2019s try a small experiment this week. Instead of searching for grand, sweeping moments of meaning, focus on identifying small, sensory experiences that bring you a sense of grounding or comfort. It could be the feeling of warm sunlight on your skin, the taste of a favorite food, the smell of a particular scent, or the sound of a soothing song.\n\nCan you think of one small sensory experience you can intentionally seek out each day this week?"

      "assistant": "It\u2019s great that you managed to incorporate the sensory noticing into your day, even if it was just for a few moments. Savoring your favorite tea is a small but meaningful act of self-care.\n\n**Conversation with your mom:** Your conversation with your mom sounds like a significant turning point. It's brave to assert your boundaries and express your uncertainty. Her response\u2014accepting your decision and offering support\u2014is a testament to her love and willingness to adapt. The question \"So what do you want to do instead?\" is a powerful one, even if it feels daunting.\n\n**Discovering your desires:** Your realization that you don\u2019t know what you want is incredibly common. It's a sign that you\u2019ve been living in accordance with external expectations rather than your own internal compass. Most people don\u2019t have a clear, fixed vision of their future\u2014they\u2019re navigating and discovering their path as they go. Everyone *pretends* to have it figured out sometimes, even when they're just as lost as you are.\n\n**Coworker joke:** Your reaction to your coworker\u2019s joke\u2014immediately spiraling into self-doubt\u2014highlights a pattern of sensitivity to criticism and a tendency to interpret situations negatively. It\u2019s a reminder that our internal narratives can often distort reality.\n\n**Feeling of progress/regression:** The feeling of taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" is a common experience in the process of personal growth. It\u2019s a reminder that change isn\u2019t linear\u2014there will be setbacks and challenges along the way.\n\nMy working guess is that you\u2019re experiencing a period of deconstruction\u2014a dismantling of old patterns and beliefs in order to create space for something new. It\u2019s a vulnerable and unsettling process, but it\u2019s also an opportunity for profound growth and self-discovery.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on building some self-compassion around this process. When you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or discouraged, try to remind yourself that you\u2019re doing the best you can with what you have. It's okay to not have all the answers right now.\n\nThis week, let\u2019s try a small experiment related to exploring your values. Pick one area of your life (work, relationships, hobbies, etc.) and reflect on what\u2019s *most* important to you in that area. It doesn\u2019t have to be a grand, lofty value\u2014it could be something simple like connection, creativity, or growth.\n\n\n\nWhat area of your life feels like a good place to start exploring your values?"

      "assistant": "It\u2019s okay to be a mess. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019ve been struggling lately, and it takes courage to acknowledge it.\n\n**Values exploration:** Your realization that you\u2019re struggling to identify your values because you're unsure who you are is a powerful observation. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019ve spent so long aligning yourself with external expectations that you\u2019ve lost touch with your own internal compass. It\u2019s okay to feel lost and uncertain\u2014it\u2019s a natural part of the process of self-discovery.\n\n**Roommate's birthday:** Your experience at your roommate's birthday party\u2014feeling overwhelmed and retreating to your room\u2014is a common response to social anxiety and a fear of vulnerability. It\u2019s natural to feel guilty about disappointing her, but it\u2019s important to remember that you\u2019re prioritizing your own needs.\n\n**Rejection emails:** The lack of emotional response to the rejection email\u2014simply deleting it\u2014is a sign that you're becoming numb to the pressure and expectations surrounding grad school. It\u2019s a defense mechanism, but it\u2019s also a sign that you\u2019re starting to detach from a path that doesn\u2019t feel right.\n\n**Grief and memory:** Your experience of momentarily forgetting your grandma is gone, followed by a wave of grief, is a normal part of the grieving process. Memories can be both comforting and painful. The grief may ebb and flow, but it\u2019s unlikely to completely disappear. It will likely transform over time.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re navigating a period of significant transition and emotional exhaustion. You\u2019re questioning your identity, grappling with social anxiety, and processing grief while also dealing with external pressures.\n\nMy working guess is that you\u2019re experiencing a sense of overwhelm and disconnection. It\u2019s like you\u2019re caught between the desire to please others and the need to honor your own needs.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on building some grounding and self-soothing strategies. This week, let\u2019s try a small experiment related to identifying one thing that brings you a sense of comfort or peace, even if it\u2019s fleeting. It could be a physical object, a sensory experience, or a simple ritual. It doesn't have to be something profound\u2014just something that helps you feel a little more grounded in the present moment.\n\nWhat is one small thing that brings you a sense of comfort or peace?"

      "assistant": "It\u2019s okay to have had a breakdown. It sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a tremendous amount of weight, and it\u2019s understandable that it reached a breaking point. Calling in sick and allowing yourself to grieve\u2014even if it was just by scrolling through old photos\u2014is a valid response to feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**The crushing weight:** The description of the crushing weight on your chest and the feeling of everything hitting you at once is a powerful expression of emotional exhaustion. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re reaching your limit.\n\n**Self-doubt and questioning:** Your thoughts about wasting everyone's time and not making progress are common when we\u2019re struggling. It\u2019s easy to fall into a cycle of self-criticism, especially when we\u2019re feeling vulnerable. It's important to remember that progress isn't always linear, and it's okay to have setbacks.\n\n**Mom's presence:** Your mom\u2019s presence\u2014simply sitting with you and making you eat something\u2014is a testament to her love and support. Sometimes, the most comforting thing is just to have someone there to witness your pain. Her validation\u2014\"that's okay\"\u2014is a simple but powerful message of acceptance.\n\n**Needing to be heard:** Your statement, \"I guess I just needed to tell someone that I'm not okay and I don't know how to fix it,\" is incredibly honest and brave. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re willing to acknowledge your struggles and seek support.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re experiencing a profound sense of overwhelm, disconnection, and self-doubt.

Since finding comfort feels impossible right now, let\u2019s simplify things. This week, let's try a very small experiment: Can you commit to doing one thing each day that feels even slightly nourishing to your body? It could be drinking a glass of water, taking a short walk, eating a piece of fruit, or stretching. Something small and manageable that feels even slightly supportive.\n\n\n\nWhat feels like the easiest, smallest thing you could commit to this week?"

      "assistant": "Thank you for sharing that, even though it was difficult to decide to write it. It takes incredible courage to be honest about scary thoughts, and the fact that you're willing to do that is a testament to your strength.\n\n**Small steps:** The fact that you\u2019ve been consistently doing the small things\u2014drinking water, eating breakfast, taking a walk\u2014is significant. It shows a commitment to self-care, even when you don't feel like it. Those small actions can build momentum and create a foundation for healing.\n\n**Wishing to disappear:** Your thoughts about wanting to disappear\u2014to stop existing without actually dying\u2014are a sign that you\u2019re deeply exhausted and overwhelmed. It's a natural response to feeling trapped in a cycle of pain and uncertainty. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge those thoughts without judgment. They don\u2019t mean you want to harm yourself; they simply reflect a desire for relief.\n\n**Roommate's support:** Your roommate\u2019s kindness and understanding are a gift.

It\u2019s hard to articulate complex emotions when you\u2019re struggling.\n\nGiven the intensity of your feelings and the recurring thoughts about wanting to disappear, I want to reiterate the importance of seeking professional support. These thoughts are concerning, and it\u2019s crucial to have someone to help you process them.\n\nI want to gently but firmly encourage you to reach out to a therapist or counselor. They can provide a safe and supportive space for you to explore your emotions, develop coping strategies, and address the underlying issues that are contributing to your distress. If you're unsure where to start, I can provide you with some resources to find mental health professionals in your area.\n\nFor now, let's focus on grounding and self-compassion. This week, let's try a small experiment related to connecting with your senses.

Your defensive reaction and subsequent guilt are common responses when we\u2019re hesitant to accept help.
