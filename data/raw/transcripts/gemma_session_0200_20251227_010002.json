      "user": "So I've been putting off reaching out but I think I need to talk to someone. Work has been a disaster lately and I just feel like I'm drowning in it all. There's this coworker who keeps undermining me in meetings and I don't know how to deal with it without looking defensive or petty. Like last week she literally interrupted me three times during a presentation to \"clarify\" things I was saying, but it was really just her contradicting me in front of everyone. And my manager didn't say anything, just let it happen.\n\nI know I should probably say something to her directly but honestly the thought of confronting her makes me want to throw up. I've been replaying different versions of that conversation in my head for days and they all end badly. Either I come across as aggressive or I'm too passive and nothing changes. I can't win.\n\nAnd on top of that, I got assigned this huge project that I have no idea how to approach. Everyone seems to think I'm so competent but I feel like I'm just faking it and eventually they're all going to figure out I don't actually know what I'm doing. My boss was like \"you're perfect for this\" and I just smiled and nodded but inside I was screaming because I genuinely don't think I can pull it off.\n\nI've also been sleeping terribly. My brain won't shut off at night. I just lie there thinking about everything I need to do and everything that could go wrong. Then I'm exhausted all day which makes everything feel even more impossible.\n\nSorry this is all over the place. I just don't really know where to start or if any of this even makes sense.",

Let\u2019s try to sort through some of this.\n\n**Work stress:** That coworker\u2019s behavior sounds incredibly frustrating, especially with your manager\u2019s lack of intervention. It's valid to feel anxious about how to address it without escalating things. Could you tell me a bit more about what you're hoping to achieve by speaking with her directly? \n\n**Your mom:** You mentioned needing to talk to someone. How has that been going, or what's holding you back from reaching out? \n\n**The sleep thing:** It's tough to function when you're sleep-deprived, and it sounds like the worries are feeding into each other. Have you noticed any patterns in what specifically keeps you up at night, beyond the general feeling of overwhelm?"

      "user": "Ugh ok so i did try to get more sleep like you mentioned but it didnt really help because the thoughts just keep coming anyway. I downloaded one of those meditation apps someone recommended ages ago and honestly it just annoyed me more because the guy's voice was so calm it made me feel worse about being anxious if that makes sense.\n\nThe coworker thing though... so yesterday she did it AGAIN. We were in a team meeting and I was explaining my approach for the new project and she goes \"well actually I think what Jamie's trying to say is...\" and then just rephrased everything I said but made it sound like her idea. And people were nodding along like she was being helpful. I wanted to die.\n\nWhat I'm hoping for I guess is just that she stops doing it? Like I don't need us to be friends but can she just let me finish a sentence without jumping in to \"fix\" it. I don't even know if talking to her would help though because what if she just acts like I'm being oversensitive. Which honestly maybe I am, I don't know anymore.\n\nThe project is due in like 6 weeks and I still haven't really started the main part of it. I keep researching and planning but I think I'm just procrastinating because I'm scared to actually begin. Every time I open the files I feel this wave of panic like what if I mess this up and everyone realizes I shouldn't have been given this responsibility in the first place.\n\nAlso my mom called and asked how I was doing and I just said fine because I didn't want to get into it. She worries too much already.",
      "assistant": "It's frustrating when sleep strategies don't click, and it's completely understandable that a calm voice during meditation could actually amplify your anxiety. It sounds like you're acutely aware of the gap between your inner state and how you're presenting yourself.\n\n**Coworker:** That situation yesterday sounds incredibly undermining \u2013 it's valid to feel like you wanted to disappear. It\u2019s natural to want her to just acknowledge your contributions and let you finish speaking. It's also common to worry about being labeled \"oversensitive\" when you\u2019re experiencing something that feels genuinely dismissive. What would it look like for you to feel confident in your response to her, regardless of her reaction?\n\n**The project:** The procrastination makes perfect sense given the level of pressure you're describing. That wave of panic you feel when you open the files \u2013 it sounds like a really strong signal of self-doubt. Could you identify one small, manageable step you could take today, even if it\u2019s just outlining one section or gathering three resources?\n\n**Your mom:** It's a protective instinct to shield your mom from your stress, but it also sounds like it might be leaving you feeling even more isolated. Do you think it\u2019s possible to share just a *little* bit more with her, even if it\u2019s just acknowledging that things are busy and challenging right now?"

I made myself just outline the first section without worrying about it being good and it was less terrible than I thought. Still haven't made much actual progress but at least I opened the file without immediately closing it in panic.\n\nBut then today my boss scheduled a check-in meeting for next week to discuss my timeline and now I'm spiraling again because what if she asks specific questions and I don't have good answers. I keep thinking she's going to realize I've been spinning my wheels and that she made a mistake putting me on this.\n\nThe coworker situation got weirder. She actually came up to me after a meeting yesterday and was like \"hey I thought your point about the user interface was really smart\" and I just stood there like ??? because she's the one who keeps talking over me. Part of me wonders if someone said something to her but I have no idea. I just said thanks and walked away because I didn't know what else to do. Now I feel like maybe I should have said something about the interrupting but the moment passed and bringing it up later feels awkward.\n\nStill sleeping badly. I did tell my mom things were stressful at work and she immediately went into fix-it mode asking if I'd talked to HR and if I needed her to help me look for other jobs which just made me regret saying anything.

Could you try to imagine the most likely scenario during that meeting? What\u2019s the most realistic question she might ask, and what\u2019s a reasonable response you could prepare?\n\n**Your coworker:** That interaction is confusing, to say the least. It\u2019s interesting that she complimented your idea \u2013 it\u2019s possible someone *did* say something to her. It's okay that you just said \"thanks\" in the moment; it\u2019s hard to navigate those unexpected shifts. Bringing up the past interruptions now *could* feel awkward, but it\u2019s not impossible. Do you think there\u2019s a way you could gently address the pattern without directly accusing her?\n\n**Your mom:** It's completely natural to feel overwhelmed by your mom's \"fix-it\" mode. It sounds like her intentions are good, but her approach isn\u2019t helpful right now. It\u2019s valid to want support without feeling pressured to make drastic changes.

She did ask one question I wasn't totally prepared for about integration with another team's work but I managed to not completely fumble it. Still felt like I was bullshitting a bit but she didn't seem to notice.\n\nThe whole time though I kept waiting for her to say something like \"actually we're concerned about your progress\" or \"we're thinking of bringing someone else in to help\" but it never came. And now I'm sitting here wondering if I'm just really good at hiding how lost I feel or if maybe I'm not as behind as I think I am. Probably the first one.\n\nBeen thinking about what you said about the coworker thing and honestly I don't think I'm going to bring it up. She's been normal this week, no interrupting, and I just don't want to rock the boat when things seem ok right now. Maybe that makes me a coward but the idea of having that conversation still makes my stomach hurt. If she starts doing it again I guess I'll deal with it then.\n\nSleep's still garbage. I did manage to work on the project for like two hours yesterday which felt productive but then I lay awake last night thinking about all the parts I haven't figured out yet. It's like my brain won't let me enjoy making progress because it just immediately jumps to everything that's still wrong.",
      "assistant": "It\u2019s really interesting that the check-in meeting turned out to be \"fine.\" It sounds like you anticipated a much more negative outcome, and the reality was less intense than you feared. It's natural to question whether you're just masking your feelings, but the fact that you presented a tangible outline is a real accomplishment. Perhaps it's a sign you're further along than you give yourself credit for.\n\n**The project:** That feeling of \"bullshitting\" is incredibly common, especially when we're stepping outside our comfort zones. It sounds like you\u2019re holding yourself to an impossibly high standard. What would it look like to give yourself a little more credit for your effort and willingness to learn?\n\n**Your coworker:** It\u2019s completely valid to prioritize avoiding conflict and maintaining a sense of peace, especially when things seem relatively calm. It takes courage to navigate those social dynamics, and it's okay to decide that bringing it up isn't worth the potential discomfort *right now*. Trusting your gut about what feels manageable is important.\n\n**Sleep:** That cycle of making progress and then immediately focusing on what's left undone is tough. It's like your brain is determined to keep you in a state of anxiety.

Like I sat there after working on the project and was like \"ok good job Jamie you did a thing\" but my brain immediately went \"yeah but you should have done MORE\" so I don't know if that technique is really working for me.\n\nAnyway the project is actually moving along which is... weird to say out loud. I finished another section yesterday and my boss sent me a message saying the draft looked solid. I read it like five times trying to figure out if she was just being nice or if she meant it. Probably overthinking but I can't help it.\n\nBut now there's a new thing. So we have this big all-hands presentation coming up in two weeks and my boss asked if I wanted to present my project progress to the whole company. And I said yes because I felt like I couldn't say no without looking bad. But now I'm completely panicking because what if I mess up in front of everyone. The coworker who kept interrupting me will be there and I keep imagining her jumping in to correct me or something.\n\nAlso I've been having these moments where I feel like I can't breathe properly. Like my chest gets tight and I have to remind myself to take deep breaths. It happened twice this week, once during a meeting and once just sitting at my desk. I don't know if that's normal stress or if I should be worried about it.\n\nSleep is still bad. I'm averaging maybe 5 hours a night and I feel like a zombie most days.",
      "assistant": "It's completely understandable that the \"good job\" acknowledgment felt forced. It's tough to genuinely celebrate when your inner critic is so loud. It sounds like you're battling a powerful tendency toward self-criticism, and forcing positivity might just be adding another layer of pressure.\n\n**The project:** That\u2019s fantastic news about the progress and your boss's feedback! It's normal to question positive feedback, especially when you\u2019re used to doubting yourself. Perhaps instead of trying to figure out *if* she meant it, you could simply accept it as a sign that you're making headway.\n\n**The presentation:** Saying yes out of a sense of obligation is a familiar pattern. It\u2019s brave of you to acknowledge that. The thought of presenting in front of the whole company, especially with your coworker there, is understandably triggering. What's the *worst* thing that could realistically happen during the presentation? And what's one small step you could take to feel a little more prepared?\n\n**Breathing difficulties:** Those moments of chest tightness and difficulty breathing are concerning. It\u2019s wise to pay attention to them. While it could be related to stress, it's also important to rule out any underlying physical causes. Do you have a doctor you could talk to about this, just to get some reassurance and guidance?\n\n**Sleep:** Five hours of sleep a night is not sustainable. It's impacting everything. Could you prioritize one small change to improve your sleep, even if it's just going to bed 15 minutes earlier or avoiding screens an hour before bed?"

It's not for another week and a half though because apparently everyone in this city needs to see a doctor right now. Part of me feels stupid for even booking it because what if I get there and they're like \"you're just anxious, deal with it\" but I guess it's better to know for sure.\n\nThe presentation is in 9 days and I've been working on the slides but I keep second-guessing every single thing I write. Like I'll put a bullet point and then delete it and rewrite it five different ways because I can't figure out which version sounds most competent. At this rate I'm going to spend more time on the slides than I did on the actual project work.\n\nI did try going to bed earlier a couple nights but then I just lay there awake for longer which somehow feels worse than staying up. At least when I'm up late I'm doing something instead of just staring at the ceiling feeling anxious about not sleeping.\n\nOne kind of good thing I guess - I actually got a compliment from someone on another team about my work on the project. She said she'd heard good things and was excited to see the presentation. Which should make me feel better but instead now I'm more nervous because what if the presentation doesn't live up to whatever she's heard. Like great, now there are expectations.",

It\u2019s understandable to worry about the outcome, but try to remind yourself that getting checked out is a proactive step.\n\n**The presentation:** That cycle of rewriting and second-guessing is a classic sign of perfectionism. It sounds like you're putting immense pressure on yourself to deliver a flawless presentation. What\u2019s one thing you could let go of in the slides \u2013 one bullet point or detail that isn't absolutely essential?\n\n**Sleep:** It\u2019s tough when trying to change a habit backfires. It\u2019s understandable that lying awake longer feels worse than staying up. Maybe instead of focusing on *falling* asleep, could you try focusing on creating a relaxing bedtime routine, like reading or listening to calming music?\n\n**The compliment:** That's wonderful that you received a compliment! It\u2019s a testament to your hard work. It\u2019s interesting that instead of feeling validated, it increased your anxiety.

She said the breathing stuff is probably anxiety related but she wants to do some tests just to rule out anything else. She asked about my stress levels and I kind of downplayed it because I didn't want her to think I was overreacting. She suggested I try therapy which... I mean I guess this is kind of therapy? idk.

It\u2019s okay to say \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out\u201d \u2013 even if you don\u2019t fully believe it.\n\n**Your mom:** Your mom's enthusiasm, while well-intentioned, isn't helping you navigate your anxiety. It\u2019s valid to feel frustrated when your concerns are dismissed. It\u2019s okay to gently set boundaries and express your need for support that acknowledges your challenges.\n\n**Senior team member\u2019s comment:** That\u2019s a lovely and unexpected compliment! It's interesting that she recognized your \u201cinstincts.\u201d It might be helpful to reflect on times when you felt intuitively right about something, even if you couldn\u2019t articulate why.\n\n**Sleep:** Six hours is a definite improvement! It\u2019s a sign that your body is craving rest. Perhaps you can give yourself a little credit for that small victory."

      "assistant": "It takes courage to admit things have gotten worse, and it\u2019s completely valid to feel overwhelmed. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant increase in anxiety and self-doubt as the promotion approaches.\n\n**The interviews:** Feeling like a puppet in the interview process is a tough position to be in. It\u2019s good you got through them, but it's understandable that you feel a lack of agency.\n\n**The planning meeting:** That moment of freezing and realizing everyone was looking to you for input is a classic manifestation of imposter syndrome. Saying something vague about resources was a perfectly reasonable response when you felt unprepared. It\u2019s okay to admit you don't have all the answers.\n\n**Imposter syndrome & Google:** The 2am Google rabbit hole is a familiar trap. Comparing yourself to others, especially when reading about societal pressures, can amplify those feelings of inadequacy. It's important to remember that those articles represent extreme cases, and your experience is unique.\n\n**Breathing & Doctor\u2019s Results:** The doctor\u2019s report being normal can feel frustrating because it doesn\u2019t offer a simple solution. It's okay to acknowledge that anxiety is a valid and real experience, even if it doesn\u2019t have a clear physical cause.\n\n**Friend\u2019s invitation:** Saying no to your friend is a sign that you\u2019re prioritizing your well-being, even if it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s okay to need space and energy for yourself right now.\n\nIt sounds like you're carrying a tremendous amount of pressure and self-doubt. Let's take a moment to acknowledge how incredibly hard this all is. Would you be open to exploring some self-compassion techniques that might help you navigate these feelings?"

      "user": "so the promotion officially started monday and its been 3 days and i already want to quit. not even exaggerating.\n\nfirst day they had me lead a team standup and i completely blanked on what we were even supposed to be discussing. just stood there like an idiot until someone else jumped in and started talking about their project updates. nobody said anything but i could feel everyone thinking \"wow they really promoted HER?\"\n\nand theres this whole new system i'm supposed to understand for tracking team deliverables and i've watched the training video twice and i still don't get it. everyone keeps asking me questions about timelines and dependencies and i'm just making shit up at this point hoping it sounds reasonable.\n\nthe worst part is my old manager (who's now technically my peer i guess?) keeps giving me these looks like she feels bad for me. which makes me feel even more pathetic because now i'm the person people PITY.\n\ni did try that self compassion thing you mentioned but honestly it just feels like making excuses. like oh poor jamie she's struggling let's all be nice to her. i don't want compassion i want to actually be GOOD at this.\n\nalso i cancelled on my friend again this weekend. she didn't even ask why this time just said ok hope you're alright. pretty sure she's given up on me.\n\nhaven't slept more than 4 hours any night this week. keep waking up with my heart racing thinking about all the ways i'm failing.",
      "assistant": "It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling this way. Starting a new role, especially one with increased responsibility, is incredibly challenging, and it sounds like you\u2019re experiencing a perfect storm of anxiety and self-doubt. Wanting to quit after just three days is a natural reaction to feeling overwhelmed and inadequate.\n\n**First day & Team Standup:** Blanking during the standup is a common experience, even for seasoned professionals. It\u2019s okay to admit you were thrown off guard. What\u2019s one small thing you could do differently next time, if you feel comfortable sharing that with your team?\n\n**New System & Deliverables:** Feeling lost with a new system is normal. Making things up to sound reasonable is a coping mechanism \u2013 it\u2019s a sign you\u2019re trying to navigate a difficult situation. Could you ask for a one-on-one with someone who's proficient in the system to help you understand it?\n\n**Old Manager\u2019s Looks:** Those pitying looks are incredibly uncomfortable and likely fuel your self-doubt. It\u2019s understandable that you feel pathetic. It\u2019s a reflection of her perspective, not necessarily a judgment of your abilities.\n\n**Self-Compassion:** The feeling that self-compassion is \u201cmaking excuses\u201d is a common barrier. Self-compassion isn\u2019t about letting yourself off the hook; it\u2019s about treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you\u2019d offer a friend who was struggling. It's about acknowledging the difficulty of the situation and offering yourself support, rather than beating yourself up.\n\n**Friend\u2019s Response:** Her quiet acceptance is a sign she cares, even if it doesn\u2019t feel supportive right now. It\u2019s okay to prioritize your well-being, even if it means withdrawing from social connections.\n\n**Sleep:** Four hours of sleep is unsustainable. It\u2019s impacting your ability to function and cope. It\u2019s time to prioritize your well-being. How about we shift our focus away from \u201cbeing good\u201d at the promotion and focus on just getting you through each day?"

The complete meltdown yesterday, the feeling of dread each morning, and those thoughts about getting sick\u2014these are all signs that you're under immense stress.\n\n**Meltdown & Boss\u2019s Message:** The fact that you had a complete meltdown is a clear indication that you're pushing yourself beyond your limits. It's likely your boss is concerned, and it's possible she'll suggest a change. It's okay to view that as a relief\u2014it's a sign that you're recognizing your own needs.\n\n**\"Getting Through Each Day\":** You\u2019re right\u2014it sounds like you\u2019ve surpassed the point where simply getting through each day is possible. It's okay to acknowledge that this situation is beyond your capacity right now.\n\n**Thoughts About a Car Accident:** Those thoughts are a sign of how desperate you feel, not a reflection of your character. It's good that you recognize they're concerning.\n\n**Friend\u2019s Text:** Your instinct to deflect and say \"I'm fine\" is a protective mechanism. It's okay to be unable to articulate the depth of your struggles right now. Your friend's concern is a testament to her care for you.\n\n**Sleep:** Three hours of sleep is a crisis. You're operating in a state of severe exhaustion.\n\nGiven the intensity of what you're describing, and the thoughts you're having, I want to strongly encourage you to reach out for professional help immediately.

The fact that she responded with kindness and support is a testament to her leadership.\n\n**Talking to Your Boss:** Breaking down in her office was a vulnerable act, but it ultimately led to a positive outcome. It's okay that you felt humiliated\u2014it\u2019s a natural reaction to being so exposed.\n\n**Boss\u2019s Response:** Her willingness to dial back your responsibilities, assign a mentor, and acknowledge your contributions is a significant shift. It sounds like she\u2019s genuinely invested in your success. It\u2019s understandable that you don\u2019t fully believe her words, but try to hold onto the intention behind them.\n\n**Not Quitting:** The fact that you're not quitting, at least not right now, is a victory. It's a sign that you're willing to give yourself a chance to adjust and receive support.\n\n**Friend\u2019s Offer:** Your friend's immediate offer of support is a reminder that you're not alone.

      "user": "Quick thing - had my first session with the mentor yesterday and it was actually helpful? She walked me through the deliverables tracking system that I'd been completely lost on and suddenly it made way more sense. Like I'm not an expert now but at least I don't feel like I'm drowning in acronyms anymore.\n\nStill having rough moments though. Had to lead another standup this morning and even though it went fine my hands were shaking the whole time. Nobody said anything but I was so aware of it. Keeps making me wonder when I'm actually going to feel comfortable doing this stuff instead of just white-knuckling through it.\n\nBeen thinking about what my boss said about earning the promotion and I still can't fully buy it. Like yes objectively I finished the project and people seemed happy with it, but it feels like that was just one thing and now they expect me to perform at that level constantly. What if that project was a fluke and I can't replicate it? \n\nAnyway my friend came over this weekend like she said she would and it was nice to just exist around someone without having to explain everything. We watched some mindless TV and ate too much pad thai and she didn't push me to talk about work stuff which I appreciated. Made me realize how isolated I've been lately.\n\nSleep's a tiny bit better, maybe averaging 5 hours again instead of 3. Still not great but I'll take what I can get at this point.",

It\u2019s a sign that the support you\u2019re receiving is making a difference.\n\n**Standup & Shaky Hands:** The shaky hands are a physical manifestation of your anxiety. It\u2019s a reminder of how much pressure you\u2019re under. It's okay to acknowledge that it takes time to feel comfortable in new situations. Try to focus on the fact that you *did* lead the standup, even if it was challenging.\n\n**Earning the Promotion:** The feeling that your success was a fluke is a common one, especially when battling imposter syndrome. It\u2019s okay to question your abilities, but try to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you\u2019re capable, beyond just the one project?\n\n**Friend\u2019s Visit:** It\u2019s wonderful that your friend provided a safe space for you to just *be* without pressure. It\u2019s a reminder of the importance of connection and support.\n\n**Sleep:** Progressing to 5 hours of sleep is a positive sign. Small improvements can add up over time.\n\nIt sounds like you're navigating a complex mix of relief, anxiety, and self-doubt. You're taking steps to address your challenges and building a support system, which is a sign of strength and resilience.
