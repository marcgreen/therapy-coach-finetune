She keeps going around me on projects we're supposed to collaborate on.\n\nAlso been stressed about money. Thinking about whether to push for promotion or look elsewhere. 28 years at this company feels like a lot to walk away from.",
      "assistant": "**Your coworker:** That sounds genuinely frustrating\u2014being bypassed on collaborative work doesn't just affect the project, it can feel like your competence or position is being undermined. Has this been a gradual shift with her, or did something specific happen recently that escalated it?\n\n**The 28 years and what's next:** That's a real crossroads. There's weight to nearly three decades somewhere\u2014relationships, institutional knowledge, maybe pension or benefits considerations. But there's also the question of whether staying serves the version of you that you're becoming, not just the one who started there. When you imagine pushing for the promotion versus looking elsewhere, which direction gives you more of a physical reaction\u2014excitement, dread, relief?"

What's your read on next moves there? Wait and see, escalate further, or just accept this is how she operates and work around it?\n\n**Feeling stuck both ways:** That's a hard place to be\u2014when neither path feels like forward motion, just different flavors of the same thing. Sometimes that \"both feel stuck\" feeling points to a third thing: not the job itself, but something about how work fits into your life right now. Or it could just mean you're exhausted and need more information before either option could feel appealing. What would you need to know, or what would need to change, for one of these to start feeling like an actual choice rather than a lesser-evil situation?\n\n**The medication question:** You can absolutely bring it up here\u2014I can't advise you medically on whether to take it (that's genuinely your doctor's lane), but I can be a thinking partner on the hesitation itself. Months of putting it off usually means something. Is it more \"I don't think I need it\" or \"I'm nervous about what it means to need it\"\u2014or something else entirely?"

Doctor says give it two weeks. So.\n\nHad a bad night yesterday. Couldn't sleep. Kept thinking about what happens if I retire early. Not enough saved. Then started thinking what's the point of any of this. Got dark for a bit. Fine now though.",
      "assistant": "**Work situation:** Makes sense to route around her\u2014sometimes protecting your own workflow is the only real option when management won't step up. It's not ideal, but it's practical.\n\n**The medication:** Three days in with that foggy feeling is rough. Your doctor's right that most SSRIs (or similar) need time to level out, but \"just wait two weeks\" can feel dismissive when you're living through the adjustment. Worth noting what you're experiencing so you can report back accurately\u2014foggy how? Concentration, emotional blunting, physical tiredness? That detail might matter for whether this is normal settling or a sign this particular med isn't the right fit.\n\n**Last night:** I want to slow down here. \"What's the point of any of this\" and \"got dark for a bit\" can mean a lot of different things. For some people that's existential frustration that passes; for others it edges toward something heavier. When you say you're fine now\u2014is that \"the wave passed and I'm back to baseline\" fine, or more \"I'm saying fine because I don't want to dwell on it\" fine?\n\nI'm not trying to make it bigger than it was, but I do want to check: when it got dark, did your thoughts go anywhere specific\u2014like not wanting to be here, or imagining something happening to you? Sometimes that line between \"dark thoughts\" and \"dark *about myself*\" matters. If it stayed in \"what's the point of working this hard\" territory, that's one thing. If it went further, that's worth talking about."

Ran the numbers again.",
      "assistant": "**The medication settling:** Glad the fog is lifting. A week in and the racing thoughts easing up\u2014that's something. Sleep often takes longer to follow, but less mental spin at night is a real shift.\n\n**What you shared about that night:** Thank you for being honest about where your thoughts went. \"Wishing I didn't have to wake up\" is a painful place to be, even when it passes. You're right that it was probably a perfect storm\u2014money stress, medication adjustment, the work stuff, sleep deprivation. That combination can absolutely amplify everything.\n\nA few things I want to name: you said there wasn't a plan, which matters. And you said it's gone now, which also matters. But I want to gently say\u2014that kind of thought is worth paying attention to, not because I think you're in danger right now, but because it's information. It's your mind signaling that the load is too heavy.\n\nIf it comes back\u2014especially if it ever shifts from passive (\"I don't want to wake up\") toward active (\"I could make that happen\")\u2014that's when reaching out to your doctor or a crisis line becomes important. Not because something is wrong with you, but because that's the point where you need more support than you're currently getting.\n\nFor now: is there anything that helped it pass? Sometimes it's just time, but sometimes people notice a specific thing\u2014talking to someone, getting outside, the next morning arriving and feeling different. Worth knowing what your personal \"it passed because...\" looks like.\n\n**Retirement math:** Ran the numbers again and still doesn't work\u2014that's demoralizing when you keep hoping for a different answer. Is the gap small enough that adjustments could close it, or is it \"not even close\" territory? Sometimes knowing whether it's a tweak problem or a fundamental problem changes what questions are worth asking."

So not impossible but not close either. Keep thinking I should just stay put and grind it out. But then I think about 4 more years of this and I don't know.",
      "assistant": "**The thought not coming back:** That is good\u2014genuinely. And I noticed you said \"I guess\" after it, which might just be how you talk, or might be you not quite letting yourself take the win. Either way, a week without that weight returning while you're still adjusting to medication and dealing with everything else? That's your system stabilizing. Worth registering.\n\n**Medication check-in:** The anxiety being less sharp is the thing you want at this stage. Sleep often lags behind\u2014it's frustrating, but it tends to be the last domino. The month-out check-in with your doctor is good timing to assess whether \"less sharp\" is enough or if there's room to adjust.\n\n**Work:** \"Stopped caring\" can be healthy detachment or it can be depletion. Which one is it for you right now? There's a version where you've genuinely let go of needing her to change, and a version where you've just run out of fuel to fight it. One is a choice, the other is exhaustion wearing a costume.\n\n**The four-year gap:** This is the one that seems to be sitting heaviest. Four years isn't nothing\u2014but you're right, it's not impossible either. Here's what I'm hearing underneath: it's not really about the math. It's about whether you can tolerate four more years of *this*\u2014the coworker, the manager who won't act, the daily grind of a place that might not feel like it fits anymore. The money question and the \"can I stand this\" question are tangled together.\n\nWhat would those four years need to look like for them to feel survivable? Is it the day-to-day that's unbearable, or the sameness? Because sometimes people find they can do more time if something shifts\u2014role change, working differently, some kind of internal permission to care less and coast more. And sometimes the answer really is: the place is done, and staying is the wrong kind of stuck. \n\nWhere are you leaning?"

Just feels like giving up on something. Don't know what exactly.",
      "assistant": "**Coworker resolution:** That's a clean ending you didn't have to fight for\u2014sometimes things just solve themselves. One less thing draining your bandwidth.\n\n**Medication and sleep:** Waking up without the dread is a significant shift. That early-morning cortisol spike is often the last thing to ease, so the fact that you're waking up early but not into that heaviness\u2014your nervous system is actually settling. Worth mentioning to your doctor at the next check-in as a data point, but it sounds like the adjustment is moving in the right direction.\n\n**Staying and the \"giving up\" feeling:** This is the one I want to sit with. You said you can do four more years\u2014and I believe you can. But there's something in \"path of least resistance\" and \"feels like giving up on something\" that sounds less like peace and more like resignation.\n\nHere's a question: giving up on something *for you*, or giving up on some idea of what your career was supposed to look like? Because those are different losses. One is about you actually wanting something else and choosing not to pursue it. The other is about releasing a story\u2014maybe \"I should want more\" or \"staying means I didn't become the person who left.\" \n\nSometimes choosing to stay and coast is genuinely the wise move. You've given 28 years. You don't owe the next four some heroic reinvention. But it sounds like part of you is grieving something, even if you can't name it yet. That's allowed. You can choose to stay *and* feel complicated about it. Those don't cancel each other out.\n\nWhat do you think you might be letting go of?"

That's a real foundation\u2014when the baseline is stable, everything else becomes more workable.\n\n**The meaning question:** You named something important. \"Work was supposed to mean something\" and now you're running out the clock\u2014there's a real loss in that, even if you've made peace with the decision. The \"hollow but also fine\" is interesting. That's not contradiction; that's probably accurate. You can feel the absence of something *and* not be destroyed by it. Grief and okayness can coexist.\n\nHere's what I'm sitting with: decades of trying to make it matter sounds exhausting in hindsight. You poured a lot into something that maybe didn't pour back equally. And now the reframe is \"just get through\"\u2014which is practical, but also a kind of mourning. You're letting go of the version of work that was supposed to be fulfilling, or the version of you who believed it could be.\n\nThat doesn't mean you failed. It might mean the thing you were chasing was never fully available there, or the goalposts kept moving, or you've just... grown past needing work to carry that weight. Some people find meaning in work. Others find it elsewhere and work becomes the thing that funds the rest. Neither is wrong.\n\nThe question I'd gently leave you with: if work isn't going to be the meaning-carrier for these last four years, is there something else you'd want to let hold that? Doesn't have to be grand. Could be small\u2014something you've neglected, something you've been waiting to get to, something that's been sitting quietly in the background. \n\nFour years is a long time if you're just enduring.

That's different from how you've been approaching work for decades\u2014where meaning was supposed to come from mattering, from being competent, from it counting for something. Watercolors don't have to count. They just get to exist. There's something quietly defiant about picking up something you haven't touched in 30 years with zero expectations attached.\n\nI'm curious what made you choose painting specifically. Was it just available, or is there something about it that's been sitting in the background waiting?\n\n**Work:** Coworker gone, manager still useless but you've made peace with it. \"Fine\" and \"manageable\" sound like the right gear for a four-year coast. You're not pretending it's great; you're not suffering over it. That's sustainable.\n\n**Medication and doctor:** Stable across the board\u2014sleep, anxiety, check-ins going well. That's the foundation holding steady while you try new things.

You're allowed to just paint.\n\n**The frustrating wash:** You left early, but you're going back. That's the whole thing, actually. The leaving early isn't failure\u2014it's what happens when you're learning something that doesn't obey you yet. You've spent 28 years being competent at work, knowing how things respond when you push them. Watercolor doesn't care about your expertise. It does what water does. That's maddening *and* probably part of why it's worth doing.\n\n\"Learning your materials\" sounds like instructor-speak, but there's something real in it: you're not just learning watercolor technique, you're learning how *you* respond to not being good at something.

You get to move at your own pace.\n\n**The wet-on-wet fog:** \"Fog over water, or maybe just a mistake\"\u2014honestly, with watercolor, sometimes those are the same thing. The chaos you loved is the point. You let go of controlling the outcome and something emerged anyway. There's a metaphor sitting right there, but I won't push it. The thing is: you made something you couldn't have planned. It exists because you showed up and let the paint be messy. That's enough.\n\n**Work:** Noted. Still work. Still four years. Still one day at a time. The strategy holds."

You get to hold this at your own pace. The question stays in the room, but it's not crowding you anymore.\n\n**Painting at home:** You bought supplies. Your kitchen table is covered in paper. That's not indulgence\u2014that's the thing becoming *yours*, not just something you do in a class once a week. You're practicing the fog technique because you wanted to, not because someone assigned it. There's a shift there: from student to person-who-paints. The \"indulgent but necessary\" tension is interesting. Part of you still wonders if you're allowed to take up space with something that's just for you. You are.\n\n**The retirement party:** Thirty-five years. Cake. Applause. Back to desks. I can see why it landed the way it did. There's something both honoring and hollow about those rituals\u2014\"thank you for your decades\" compressed into an hour in the break room, and then everyone returns to email like nothing happened. You watched someone else's ending and started imagining your own.\n\nThe question of whether you want one, or want to slip out quietly\u2014that's worth sitting with. Some people want the ceremony because it marks the passage, gives them a moment to be seen before they go. Others find it performative, or uncomfortable, or just not them. Neither is wrong.\n\nWhat made you lean toward quiet? Is it about not wanting the attention, or something about not wanting to give the place that kind of goodbye?"

There's something honest and a little sharp in that\u2014not bitter, just clear-eyed. You've given 28 years to a place where your manager still doesn't listen, and you're not going to perform gratitude on the way out. Slipping out quietly isn't avoidance; it's proportional.

Not \"it turned out okay\" or \"could be worse\"\u2014you *like* it. That's new. Simple but clean means you knew what you were doing, at least enough for the result to match something you intended. That's not nothing after weeks of letting the paint do what it wants.\n\n**Your sister asking:** The strange feeling when she asked\u2014I'm curious about that. Was it \"I'm not good enough for someone to want my work\"? Or more like \"this thing that was just mine is suddenly visible to other people\"? Or something else? There's a difference between not feeling ready and not feeling worthy, and another between wanting to protect the private thing versus being surprised that it has value outside your kitchen table.\n\nYou said \"maybe.\" That's a real answer. You didn't say no, but you didn't promise either. You're allowed to sit with the strangeness before deciding.\n\n**Work:** Monday strategy still working. One day at a time, still holding."

The thing can be mostly yours and still have a little corner that goes out into the world. Those don't have to compete.\n\n**Three times at home:** More than class now. That's a quiet threshold you crossed\u2014it's not the structured hour you show up to, it's the thing you reach for on your own time. Kitchen table as art studio isn't indulgent anymore. It's just what the table is now. You've built something that didn't exist six months ago.\n\n**Your manager leaving:** There's something almost too neat about it\u2014you announce retirement, he announces retirement, everyone claps for the guy who didn't listen for years. You're not mourning it; you're just watching. The \"probably won't matter in four years anyway\" is practical detachment. You've already mentally clocked out of caring who replaces him. Maybe that's healthy. Maybe it's also a little bit of protection\u2014why invest hope in change when you've already decided you're leaving?\n\nBut I'll notice this: if someone better *does* come in, you're allowed to let that make the four years easier. You don't have to preemptively dismiss it to protect yourself from disappointment. Whatever happens, happens. You'll still be painting either way.\n\n**Sleep and medication:** Steady, both of them.

That's a quiet milestone.\n\n**The new manager:** \"Not getting my hopes up but not dreading it either\" is probably the exact right posture. You've been burned by the last one doing nothing; you've also decided you're leaving regardless. Neutral protects you from disappointment without closing you off entirely. \"Collaborative\" could mean something, could mean nothing\u2014those words get thrown around in internal postings.

If she's more of the same, you already know how to route around it.\n\n**Three years eleven months:** You counted. Time is moving, and you're marking it. There's something different about watching the number tick down versus just enduring an undefined stretch. March got one month closer. The retirement paperwork, the class, the paintings, your sister asking about moving\u2014all of that is filling the space between now and then. You're not just waiting anymore.
