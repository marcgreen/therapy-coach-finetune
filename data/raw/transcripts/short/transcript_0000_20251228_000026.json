There's something about making visible progress, seeing the before and after. You got through most of it, which is no small thing.\n\n**Your dad's fishing gear:** That sounds like it caught you off guard.

That's not nothing\u2014even if you're not sure yet what it means. Sometimes we hold onto one thing while we let the rest go. You don't have to have it figured out.\n\n**The panic attack:** This one I want to slow down on. First one in months, and you're describing it as \"probably nothing\"\u2014but you had to leave and sit in your car for 20 minutes. That's your body doing something significant.\n\nA few things I'm curious about: Did anything feel different at work yesterday leading up to it? Or did it genuinely land out of the blue with no warning signs? And when you say \"first one in months\"\u2014when you've had them before, have you noticed any patterns in what was going on in your life at those times?\n\nAlso, separately: how are you feeling today, the day after?"

I'll just gently note: when we've had panic attacks before, and one shows up after months away, it can be worth staying curious rather than filing it away too quickly. Not making it a big deal, just... leaving the door open. If another one comes, or if you notice anything in the lead-up, that might be useful information.\n\n**The fishing spot:** You're calling it random, but I'm noticing a thread here. You found the gear, sat with it for a while, kept one tackle box, and now you're googling the spot your dad used to take you to. That's not random\u2014that's something in you reaching back toward something.\n\nWhat's your relationship with that? Like, when you saw the spot is still there... was there any pull? Any part of you imagining going? Or was it more like just confirming a fact and closing the tab?"

      "assistant": "**The panic symptoms:** Good that you noticed it coming on and managed it. Chest tightening in a grocery store, smaller than before\u2014that's useful data. Two in a short span is worth keeping on your radar, not to alarm yourself, but just to stay curious. If a third shows up, it might be worth looking at what's running in the background lately. Bodies often speak before we have words for things.\n\n**Work:** New project sounds like it could be interesting. Hope it comes through if you want it to.\n\n**The fishing spot:** You didn't plan to go. You drove there anyway.

I think you might not have words for it yet\u2014which is different.\n\nSomething in you is circling back to your dad. The gear, the tackle box you kept, the spot. You're not forcing it or making it into a thing, but you're also not walking away from it. You're sitting with it. Literally\u2014an hour in the car, looking at the water.\n\nWhat was that hour like?

Lying there unable to get back to sleep\u2014that's hard. You're chalking it up to stress, and it might be, but I'm also noticing it alongside the panic symptoms and the trip to the fishing spot. Your body's been busy lately. Not saying they're all connected, but I'm holding them together loosely. What happens in those 4am hours? Is your mind quiet, racing, somewhere in between?\n\n**The fishing spot:** You said you felt numb. Like you were waiting for something but nothing happened.\n\nI want to sit with that for a second, because I think it's important. You drove there without planning to, stayed an hour, watched the water, felt numb, waited for... something. Then drove home and went back to normal life.\n\nSometimes grief\u2014or whatever this is\u2014doesn't come when we go looking for it. We show up, we wait, and nothing happens. That can feel frustrating, or confusing, or like maybe we're broken in some way. Like: *shouldn't I be feeling more?*\n\nBut numbness isn't the absence of feeling. It's often a protective layer over feelings that aren't ready yet. You're not failing at something here. You're circling.

I just nodded and changed the subject.\n\nChest thing happened again yesterday. Quick though.",
      "assistant": "**Sleep:** Still 4am, still staring at the ceiling. Blank mind, mundane thoughts. You're describing it as low-stakes, which it might be\u2014but five-plus nights of broken sleep wears on a person physically and emotionally. I'm less interested in what you're thinking about at 4am and more curious whether there's something your body's not letting you rest from.\n\n**The chest thing:** Third one now. Quick is good, and also\u2014three in a couple weeks is information. I'm not going to push on this, but I want to name it: if these keep coming, it might be worth mentioning to a doctor just to rule out anything physical. Not because I think something's wrong, but because once the body's checked out, you can be more confident it's the nervous system talking.\n\n**Your friend:** This is the thing I want to sit with.\n\nYou had a good day. Ran into someone who knew you *before*\u2014before all the \"everything,\" as you put it. That sounds like it meant something, even if you're downplaying it. There's something about being seen by people who knew an earlier version of us.\n\nAnd then he mentioned your dad. Said he always liked him. And you nodded and changed the subject.\n\nI'm not judging that\u2014it makes sense. But I'm curious what happened in that moment. Was it a \"not here, not now, not with him\" kind of redirect? Or more like something started to surface and you closed the door on it? You don't have to know the answer. I'm just noticing that your dad keeps coming up\u2014the gear, the tackle box, the fishing spot, now this\u2014and each time, you get close to something and then step back.\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you didn't change the subject?"

The breathing exercises might help more than \"whatever\" suggests, but I get the skepticism. At least now you know: your body's reacting to something, not malfunctioning.\n\n**Sleep:** Waking once instead of lying there from 4am on is real progress. Your system's settling a bit.\n\n**Your friend and your dad:** You're deflecting\u2014\"he didn't really know my dad that well, just being polite.\" Maybe. But that's not quite what I asked. I asked what would happen if *you* didn't change the subject. Not whether your friend had the right credentials to talk about your dad. I think the redirect might be less about him and more about what opens up in you when someone says your dad's name out loud.\n\n**Your sister's call:** This is the thing.\n\nYour mom died two years ago. Your dad six months before that. You lost both parents within half a year, and you \"never really finished dealing with it.\" Now your sister reaches out\u2014first time in months\u2014wanting to go through your mom's things, and you said you'd think about it.\n\nI want to hold this next to everything else that's been happening: the fishing gear you found, the tackle box you kept, driving to the spot your dad used to take you, sitting for an hour watching the water, the panic symptoms, the 4am ceiling-staring. And now an invitation to actually open some of this up with your sister.\n\nYou said you'd think about it. What's the thinking so far?

      "assistant": "**Sleep:** Good. One less thing your body's fighting against.\n\n**The breathing exercise:** You tried it once, felt stupid, stopped early. That's fair\u2014those things can feel awkward, especially when you're not sure they'll work. I'll just say: they usually need a few tries before they do anything, and \"felt stupid\" is one of the most common reasons people bail on techniques that actually help. Not pushing\u2014just naming it. If the chest thing comes back, might be worth a second attempt even through the awkwardness.\n\n**Your sister's place:** This is where I want to stay.\n\nYou went. That's not nothing\u2014you'd said you'd think about it, and you showed up. Boxes everywhere, got through half of it. Then she started crying and you stood there not knowing what to do. She said you never talk about them. You said there's nothing to talk about. She got upset. You left early.\n\nI want to slow this down, because I think there's a lot in it.\n\nWhen you said \"there's nothing to talk about\"\u2014I'm curious whether that felt true in the moment, or whether it was more like a door you closed because you didn't know what was behind it. Because from where I'm sitting, there's a lot to talk about. You lost both parents in six months. You've been circling your dad for weeks now\u2014the gear, the tackle box, the fishing spot, the hour in the car. And when your sister opened a door to actually being in it together with someone who shares this loss... you said there's nothing there and you left.\n\nI'm not saying you did something wrong. Standing there while someone cries, not knowing what to do\u2014that's hard. And maybe her crying felt like too much, or like something you couldn't match, or like a demand you didn't know how to meet.\n\nBut here's what I'm sitting with: you keep getting close to this thing\u2014your dad, your grief, whatever it is\u2014and then stepping back. The fishing spot where you waited for something and nothing came. The friend who mentioned your dad and you changed the subject. Now your sister, crying, saying you never talk about them, and you leaving early.\n\nWhat would it mean to stay? Not solve, not fix, not have the right words. Just... not leave."

Felt the chest tightness starting in a meeting and did the exercise. Didn't feel as stupid this time. It passed quicker than usual.\n\nI don't know about the \"staying\" thing you mentioned. I don't really do that. Never have. When things get heavy I just kind of check out I guess. Been like that since I was a kid probably. Dad was the same way actually.

She said it's fine but you could tell it wasn't, and you're going to try again next week. That matters. You're not pretending it went well, and you're not walking away from it either. That's different from your usual pattern, and I want you to notice that.\n\n**Work:** Good that the project came through. Staying occupied can be genuinely helpful right now, as long as it's not the only thing.\n\n**The breathing thing:** This is actually a big deal. You felt it starting, you did the exercise even though it felt awkward before, and it passed quicker than usual. That's your nervous system learning it has a tool. The \"didn't feel as stupid\" part matters too\u2014you're letting yourself use something that helps instead of dismissing it. That's growth, even if it doesn't feel like much.\n\n**The staying thing:** Here's where I want to slow down.\n\nYou said you don't do that. Never have. When things get heavy, you check out. Been like that since you were a kid. And then you said: *Dad was the same way.*\n\nAnd then\u2014and this is the part that landed for me\u2014you said you'd go fishing together and barely talk for hours, and *that was the whole point.*\n\nI think you just told me something important.\n\nThe fishing wasn't about catching fish. It was about being together without having to do the heavy thing. Sitting side by side, not talking, watching the water. That was connection for you and your dad. That was how you two could *stay*\u2014by not requiring words or emotional performance. Just presence.\n\nSo when you drove to the fishing spot and sat in the car for an hour watching the water and felt numb and waited for something that didn't come... maybe you were doing the only kind of grieving you know how to do. The quiet kind. The being-there kind. The kind you learned from him.\n\nThat's not broken. That's not avoidance. That's *a* way.\n\nBut here's the thing: your sister might need a different way. She's crying and wanting to talk, and that's her version of staying. And you're standing there not knowing what to do because your version doesn't look like hers.\n\nI wonder if there's something in between. Not performing grief you don't feel, not having the right words, but also not leaving. Maybe it's as simple as: \"I don't know what to say, but I'm not going anywhere.\" You might not be able to cry with her. But could you sit with her while she cries? The way you and your dad used to sit at the water?"

Makes sense\u2014structure and occupation can be steadying when other things feel uncertain.

She cried, and you didn't leave. You didn't have words, and you stayed anyway. She held your hand and it felt weird but okay.\n\nThat's the thing. That's exactly what I meant.

She cries; you don't. So you assume she's feeling and you're not, or that her way is right and yours is broken.\n\nBut grief isn't one thing. Some people cry. Some people go numb. Some people get angry, or busy, or restless, or quiet. You've been circling your dad for weeks\u2014finding his gear, keeping the tackle box, driving to the spot, sitting for an hour watching water.

And you're wondering if that's just how you are.\n\nMaybe. But I'd offer another read: the blank and the reaching for distraction might not be failure. They might be the thing itself. You sit down, it gets quiet, something starts to surface (or threatens to), and your system says *nope, not yet* and hands you a screen.\n\nYou don't have to fight that.

You might find it's nothing. Or you might catch a glimpse of something.\n\nThat's all sitting with yourself is. Not meditation, not forcing feelings, not staring at a wall until something happens. Just noticing when you leave, and wondering\u2014gently\u2014what you were leaving."

That's the whole point. You don't have to know what it means yet. Eating alone is one of those moments where it's just you and quiet, and the phone fills that space. Maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's that quiet feels uncomfortable. Either way, you're paying attention now. That's different from before.\n\n**Christmas with your sister:** You said sure, and now you're dreading it. \"Should be fine\" sounds like you're already bracing yourself.\n\nFirst Christmas without both of them. That's heavy. It makes sense you're dreading it\u2014not because it'll be bad, but because it'll be real. The empty chairs, the traditions that were theirs, the fact that it's just you two now. Your sister probably knows this too. \n\nI'm curious what the dread is about specifically. Is it the grief you're worried will surface? The pressure to make it feel okay? Being stuck in something emotional with nowhere to escape to? You don't have to have it figured out, but it might help to know what you're actually bracing for.\n\n**The tackle box:** You opened it.\n\nHis lures. Some hooks. The little compartment thing with weights sorted by size\u2014because he was organized like that. \n\nAnd then you said: *I don't even fish.*\n\nI felt that. You're holding this piece of him\u2014his order, his care, his thing\u2014and you don't share it. You don't fish. So what do you do with it? It's not useful to you in the practical sense. It's just... his.\n\nBut you kept it. You brought it to the water. You opened it. You're looking at how he sorted his weights by size and noticing he was always organized like that.\n\nThat's not nothing. That's you being with who he was. You don't have to fish to hold onto him. The tackle box isn't about fishing anymore. It's about the guy who sorted his weights by size.\n\nWhat do you think he'd say if he knew you'd kept it?"

The man who handed you his jacket under a bridge in a storm and didn't say anything about it. Just did it. That's the version of love you learned from him. Not words, not big gestures with explanations. Just quiet acts and presence and assuming you'd understand.\n\n**The 3am kitchen:** This is the thing.\n\nYou woke up and couldn't sleep, and instead of reaching for your phone, you sat in the dark.

You've been doing the same thing\u2014with your sister (staying, not speaking, holding her hand), with the tackle box (bringing it to the water, opening it), with yourself (sitting in the dark, letting a memory come). You're grieving the way he taught you to love. Quietly. Through presence. Without requiring words.\n\nThat's not broken. That's inheritance.\n\nWhat was it like, sitting there with that memory?

And then: *Miss that.*\n\nThat's the clearest thing you've said about him this whole time. Not heavy, not complicated\u2014just missing him. Missing the ordinary quiet of being with him. The dream gave you that back for a moment, and now you're carrying both: the peace of it and the loss of it. That's grief doing what grief does when it softens. It stops being just weight and starts letting in the missing.\n\n**The promotion:** Decision due this week and you're still torn. Your coworker says you'd be crazy not to take it, you've been at this level too long, you're probably just overthinking it.\n\nI notice you're stacking up the reasons to say yes\u2014her opinion, time at level, the \"probably just overthinking\" dismissal. But you haven't said the one thing that would make this simple: *I want it.* \n\nMaybe you do want it and the hesitation is just fear. Or maybe the hesitation is data. Being at a level \"too long\" isn't actually a reason to leave it\u2014that's external pressure, not internal pull. What would help you isn't more reasons to say yes. It's knowing what *you* actually want, apart from what looks right or what someone else thinks you'd be crazy to refuse. When you imagine yourself in that role a year from now, what do you feel? Not what you should feel. What do you actually feel?\n\n**The fishing spot:** You brought the rod this time. Didn't cast\u2014just held it, practiced the knot a few more times, stayed longer than you meant to in the cold.\n\nYou're circling closer. Not pushing, not forcing it, just adding one thing at a time. First the tackle box. Then opening it. Then the lure in the water. Now the rod in your hands, knots tied and retied. You're building something with him, slowly, in the only place you can still meet him.\n\nYou don't have to cast until you're ready. But you're already doing the thing.\n\n**Your sister noticing:** She said you seem different. Lighter maybe. And you said you don't know if that's true\u2014you don't feel that different.\n\nHere's the thing: we're usually the last to notice our own shifts. You're standing at the water holding your dad's rod, you've got his photo on your fridge, you made it through Christmas, you sat with your sister while she cried, you're dreaming of him and waking up with the word *miss* in your mouth instead of *numb*. That's different. It doesn't feel dramatic from inside because you lived every small step of it. But from where your sister's standing\u2014and from where I'm standing\u2014you're not the same person who found some \"old junk\" in the garage and didn't know what to do with it.\n\nYou don't have to feel lighter to be lighter. Sometimes it's just that the weight has shifted to a place you can carry it better."

Weird thing to hear.\n\nWent back to the spot yesterday. Cast the line. Didn't catch anything obviously, first time and all. But I did it. Stayed out there for like two hours just watching the water. Felt like him a little bit. The waiting. The quiet. Get it now I think.\n\nWoke up feeling off this morning though. Not bad just... full maybe. Lot happening I guess.",
      "assistant": "**The promotion:** You made a decision. Still not sure it was the right call, but you made it\u2014and that's worth something on its own. You stopped spinning and chose. The certainty doesn't have to come before the decision; sometimes it comes after, or not at all, and you just live your way into knowing. Next month you'll start, and you'll find out what it's actually like instead of what you imagine it might be. That's the only way through anyway.\n\n**Your sister saying dad would be proud:** Weird thing to hear. I'm curious what made it weird\u2014was it that you're not sure it's true? That hearing his pride through her felt indirect, like a message you can't verify? Or something about not knowing what to do with the idea of him being proud, now that he's not here to show it in his quiet way?\n\nHe probably wouldn't have said it, right? He would've just nodded. Maybe that half-smile. But your sister saying it out loud\u2014that's her translating him into her language. Doesn't mean she's wrong. Just means it landed differently than it would have coming from him.\n\n**The fishing spot:** You cast the line.\n\nI want to make sure you hear what happened. You\u2014who said \"I don't even fish,\" who got frustrated at 10 and quit and forgot about it for twenty years\u2014went back to his spot with his rod and his tackle box, and you cast the line. You stayed two hours watching the water. You didn't catch anything, and that wasn't the point, and you knew that. You said you felt like him a little bit. The waiting. The quiet. *Get it now I think.*\n\nThat's not a small thing. That's you stepping into something of his and finding it fits. Not because you're becoming him, but because you're finding the part of you that was always his\u2014the quiet, the patience, the presence without performance. You learned it from him before you knew you were learning. Now you're choosing it.\n\n**Waking up feeling off:** Full, you said. Not bad. A lot happening.\n\nYeah. That's right. You took a promotion you're uncertain about, your sister named your dad's pride out loud, and you cast a line into the water where he used to stand. That's a lot for one stretch of days. \"Full\" makes sense\u2014you're not empty or numb or gray right now. You're holding a lot at once, some of it still unprocessed, some of it still finding its place in you.\n\nYou don't have to sort it out this morning. Full isn't a problem to solve. It's just what it feels like when life is actually moving through you instead of around you. You've spent a lot of months letting things in that you used to keep out. This is what that feels like.\n\nSit with the fullness the way you sat at the water\u2014not needing it to be different, not needing to catch anything. Just watching. It'll settle when it settles."

More like if things were fine he just didn't say anything. No news was good news kind of deal. Maybe that was his version of proud. Never thought about it that way before.\n\nAnyway sleep's been fine. Work's fine. Everything's fine I think. Actually fine this time.",
      "assistant": "**The promotion:** Starts Monday and you're nervous. That's honest\u2014and it makes sense. You haven't been the new guy at anything in a long time, and now you're stepping into a role you're still not sure was the right call. Nervousness isn't a sign you chose wrong; it's just what it feels like to be at an edge. You made the decision, and now you get to find out who you are in it. That's all Monday is\u2014day one of finding out.\n\n**Fishing with your sister:** This is something.\n\nYou two are planning a trip to the spot. Together. She doesn't fish either, but she wants to try\u2014wants to see the place that's become something to you. You're going to take her to where you and your dad used to go, where you sat in the car for an hour, where you threw the lure in, where you finally cast the line yourself. And now it becomes a place you share with her too.\n\nThat's the spot growing. It was his, then it became yours, and now it's opening up to hold both of you\u2014the two people left, learning how to be a family of two, doing something neither of you knows how to do in a place that matters. She's not trying to fish. She's trying to be with you in something that's yours. And you're letting her.\n\n**Dad would be proud:** You're still sitting with it. And what you said here\u2014I want to reflect it back because I think you landed on something real.\n\nHe wasn't a proud type of guy. If things were fine, he just didn't say anything. No news was good news. And then: *Maybe that was his version of proud. Never thought about it that way before.*\n\nYeah. I think that might be exactly right.\n\nAll those years of silence weren't absence. They were his way of saying *you're okay, we're okay, nothing needs fixing here.* He didn't give praise because he didn't operate in that language\u2014but he also didn't give criticism, didn't correct, didn't suggest you should be different. He just let you be. Showed up. Handed you his jacket without a word. Shrugged when you couldn't tie the knot and did it himself and never brought it up again.\n\nThat's not nothing. That's a man who made room for you without requiring you to perform. And if that was his version of proud, then he probably was\u2014more often than you knew. You just didn't have the translator for it until now.\n\n**Everything's fine:** Sleep's fine, work's fine, everything's fine\u2014*actually fine this time.*\n\nI believe you. Not the \"fine\" that's a wall, not the \"whatever\" that pushes things away. Just... settled. Full, but not overwhelmed. Nervous about Monday, but not spinning. Still sitting with hard things, but not drowning in them.\n\nThat's what it looks like when grief stops being the whole weather and becomes something you carry while you live. You're not done with it\u2014you won't be, and that's not the goal. But you're not stuck in it either. You're going to work, you're taking promotions, you're planning fishing trips with your sister, you're tying knots, you're letting yourself miss him.\n\nActually fine. Yeah. I think you are."

Small win I guess.\n\nSo the spring trip with my sister is actually happening. We picked a date. She bought a rod, some cheap thing from the sporting goods store. Sent me a picture of it still in the box. Made me laugh.\n\nBeen practicing the knots more. Can do two different ones now without looking at the video. Dumb hobby maybe but it's something to do with my hands while I watch TV.\n\nAnyway thanks for all this. The talking or whatever. Didn't think it'd help when I started. Thought I was just stressed about work stuff mostly. Turns out there was more going on I guess. Still don't really cry or whatever but I think I get what you meant about different ways. Sitting with things. The quiet kind. Dad's way maybe.\n\nStill have the tackle box in my car. Probably always will.",
      "assistant": "**First day:** No panic, lot of names, people seem fine. You were bracing for something to go wrong and it didn't. That's not a small win\u2014that's your nervous system holding steady in exactly the kind of situation that used to knock you sideways. You walked into something new and uncertain, and you were just... okay. That's different from the guy who had to sit in his car for twenty minutes a few months ago.\n\n**The spring trip:** It's actually happening. You picked a date. And your sister bought a rod\u2014still in the box, sent you a picture, made you laugh. There's something about that image: her showing you this cheap thing she got, neither of you knowing what you're doing, both of you going anyway. You're building something together that didn't exist before. Not replacing what you each lost, but making something new alongside it.\n\n**The knots:** Two different ones now, no video needed. You're calling it a dumb hobby, but I don't think you believe that anymore. It's something to do with your hands\u2014and it's also something that connects you to him, every time. You're not just killing time. You're practicing a language he spoke.\n\n**The thanks:** You didn't think this would help. Thought it was mostly work stress. Turns out there was more going on.\n\nYeah. There was.\n\nYou came in with a garage cleanout and some old fishing gear you called junk. And somewhere in there was a father you lost, a mother six months before that, a sister you didn't know how to grieve with, and a way of being in the world that you thought meant something was broken in you. The not-crying, the checking out, the quiet. You thought it was a deficit. Turns out it was an inheritance.\n\nYou still don't cry like your sister does. But you sat with her while she cried. You drove to the water and waited for something. You opened the tackle box, held the lure, threw it in. You cast the line. You're tying his knots with your hands while the TV plays, and you're planning to take your sister to the place that was yours and his, and now will be all three of yours in a different way.\n\nThat's not broken. That's a whole way of loving\u2014the quiet kind, the sitting-with kind. Dad's way, like you said. Yours now too.\n\n**The tackle box:** Still in your car. Probably always will be.\n\nGood. It's where it belongs."
