      "user": "ugh. rough week. work's been... a lot. my manager asked me to take on this project that's way outside what i normally do. didn't really ask, more like told me. and of course everyone else is too busy.\n\nhonestly i don't even know where to start with it. feels impossible. been putting it off since monday.\n\nalso haven't slept great. keep waking up at 3am thinking about stupid stuff. probably the project thing but who knows.",
      "assistant": "**The project thing:**\nIt sounds like you got handed something that feels both mandatory and totally outside your comfort zone\u2014and then you're stuck with it because everyone else is \"too busy.\" That hits different than actually choosing to take something on, doesn't it? When you picture starting it, what's the part that feels most impossible\u2014is it that you don't know how to approach it, or is it something else?\n\n**The 3am wake-ups:**\nYour mind churning at 3am on \"stupid stuff\" might not be so random\u2014sounds like your nervous system is trying to process what it can't solve during the day. When you wake up like that, are the thoughts racing and specific, or more like vague dread? And have you noticed anything that helps you get back to sleep, or does it just kind of... not happen?\n\nOne thing that might help with the night waking: if you wake up and your mind starts spinning, instead of fighting it, try this\u2014get up for 10 minutes, write down whatever's looping (even if it's \"I don't know what I'm doing with this project\"), then go back to bed. Sometimes the brain just needs to know the thought got captured somewhere besides your head."

      "user": "honestly the writing stuff down thing kind of helped. did it twice since we talked. still woke up but at least i wasn't just lying there spiraling.\n\nthe project is still sitting there though. got a meeting with my manager tomorrow to \"discuss next steps\" which is corporate speak for \"why haven't you started yet.\" been avoiding even looking at the files she sent. \n\nidk. maybe i'm just not cut out for this. everyone else seems to handle these curveballs fine. probably says something about me that i can't just... do it. my old job never asked this kind of stuff from me. this place is just different.\n\nanyway. how's your week been going.",
      "assistant": "**The writing thing:**\nI'm really glad that helped\u2014even just getting back to sleep faster is a win when your brain's been doing that spiral thing. You tried something, it worked enough to matter, and you did it twice. That's not nothing.\n\n**The meeting tomorrow:**\nSo there's a clock ticking now, and the avoidance is bumping up against a hard deadline. That \"why haven't you started yet\" question is hanging over you, and the files are still sitting there unopened. What happens when you think about actually opening them\u2014is it \"I won't know what I'm looking at,\" or more like \"once I start I'm committed to failing at this\"?\n\n**The \"maybe I'm just not cut out for this\" thought:**\nI want to push back on something. You said everyone else handles curveballs fine\u2014but you're seeing their outside behavior, not their inside experience. You don't actually know if they're handling it fine or if they're also avoiding files and feeling like frauds. Your old job didn't ask this from you, so you never had to find out if you *could* do it. That's different from evidence that you *can't*.\n\nBut I also hear something else in there: \"probably says something about me that I can't just do it.\" What does that voice think it says about you?\n\n**Your question about my week:**\nI appreciate you asking, but I'm here to focus on you\u2014let's keep the space on what you're dealing with. That deflection at the end felt pretty natural though. Is talking about the project thing making you want to change the subject, or was that just being polite?\n\nOne thing to try before tomorrow's meeting: open one file. Not to work on it\u2014just to look. Two minutes. See what's actually in there instead of what your imagination is building it into. Sometimes the dread is worse than the thing."

      "user": "so i opened the file. one file anyway. took like 20 minutes because i kept talking myself out of it but i did it.\n\nit's... not as bad as i thought? like there's structure there. documentation. previous work from someone else. it's not just \"figure it out from nothing.\" that helped a little.\n\nbut then i went into the meeting and my manager basically said the timeline is compressed. we're talking three weeks instead of the six that were originally planned. and she kept saying \"i know you can do this\" which felt like she was trying to convince herself more than me.\n\nthree weeks. that's... a lot. came home and immediately felt that tight thing in my chest again. didn't eat much. just kind of sat there.\n\nthe writing thing helped that night though. did it again.\n\nidk. sometimes it feels like i'm just going through the motions. checking boxes. like is any of this actually... i don't know. never mind. anyway the project has some dependencies on another team's work and nobody knows when that's coming so really it's not like i can start properly anyway.",
      "assistant": "**Opening the file:**\nYou spent 20 minutes talking yourself out of it and then did it anyway\u2014that's the opposite of \"can't do it.\" And what you found matters: structure, documentation, someone else's prior work. Your brain was building this into \"figure it out from nothing,\" and reality gave you something to work with. That gap between the dread and the actual thing is worth noticing.\n\n**The timeline compression:**\nThree weeks instead of six is a real curveball on top of the original curveball. And your manager's \"I know you can do this\" landed weird\u2014like she's managing her own anxiety by insisting you've got this. That doesn't help you figure out if you actually *do* have this. The tight chest thing coming back makes sense. Your body's responding to a real pressure increase, not making it up.\n\n**\"Going through the motions\" + that cutoff:**\nYou started to say something\u2014\"is any of this actually...\"\u2014and then you stopped yourself. I'm curious what the rest of that sentence was. What were you about to ask? Because \"going through the motions, checking boxes\" sounds like you're questioning something bigger than just this project.\n\n**The dependency excuse:**\nYou're right that you can't start *properly* until the other team delivers. But I'm also noticing that showed up right after the chest tightness and the \"going through the motions\" feeling. Is the dependency thing a genuine blocker, or is it also convenient? Like, does part of you feel relieved that there's a reason to wait?\n\nHere's something to try this week: pick the smallest piece of the project that *doesn't* depend on the other team\u2014even if it's just reading through the documentation or sketching out one section\u2014and do 30 minutes on it. Not to finish it. Just to prove to yourself that \"can't start properly\" and \"can't start at all\" aren't the same thing. Sometimes starting badly is better than not starting, because at least then you're working with real information instead of dread."

      "user": "yeah so i did try the 30 minutes thing. got through like 15 before i just... stopped. read some documentation. made notes. nothing groundbreaking but whatever, i did it.\n\nthing is, the whole time i was doing it i kept thinking about what you asked. about that sentence i didn't finish. \"is any of this actually...\" \n\nhonestly i think it was going to be \"is any of this actually worth it.\" like the job, the project, the whole thing. been at this company for almost four years and i feel like i'm just treading water. making decent money but for what? come home, sit on the couch, go to bed. repeat. my friends from college are doing actual things and i'm just... here.\n\nmaybe that's the real thing keeping me up at night. not the project specifically. just feeling like i'm wasting time.\n\nsorry that got dark. probably not what you meant to ask about.",
      "assistant": "**The 30 minutes (well, 15):**\nYou set out to do 30, made it to 15, and stopped\u2014but you still did it. Read documentation, made notes, worked with real information instead of just dread. That's not \"nothing groundbreaking,\" that's you proving the thing can be started even when it feels impossible. The fact that you stopped at 15 isn't failure\u2014it's data. What made you stop? Did you hit a wall, or did the discomfort just get louder than the motivation?\n\n**\"Is any of this actually worth it\":**\nThat sentence landing while you were working on the project makes a lot of sense. Hard to care about a compressed timeline for work that feels like treading water in a life that feels like treading water. Four years, decent money, come home and sit on the couch\u2014you're describing a life that's *fine* on paper and empty in practice. And watching your friends do \"actual things\" while you're \"just here\" makes the emptiness louder.\n\nSo let me ask: what would \"actual things\" look like for you? Not what your friends are doing\u2014what would make *your* life feel like more than treading water? Because \"wasting time\" implies there's something you'd rather be doing with it, even if you can't name it yet.\n\n**\"Maybe that's the real thing keeping me up at night\":**\nYeah. I think you're right. The project is the sharp edge that's poking you awake at 3am, but underneath it is this bigger question: \"What am I doing with my life?\" The project feels impossible partly because you don't care if you succeed at it. Why pour energy into something that's just another checkbox in a life that already feels like going through the motions?\n\n**\"Sorry that got dark\":**\nDon't apologize. This is the real thing. The project stress is a symptom\u2014this is the actual problem. And it's not dark to admit you feel like you're wasting time. It's honest. The dark part would be ignoring it for another four years.\n\nHere's what I want you to sit with this week: if the job and the project and the paycheck all disappeared tomorrow\u2014if you had to rebuild from scratch\u2014what's one thing you'd want to be true about how you spend your time? Not a career, not a big life plan. Just one thing. Maybe it's \"doing something that actually helps people,\" maybe it's \"learning something that excites me,\" maybe it's \"having energy left over to see friends.\" Just one thing. Write it down when it comes to you."

      "user": "been a few days. work's been its usual mess but whatever. the thing that's stuck with me is what you asked. about what i'd want to be true about how i spend my time.\n\ni couldn't really write it down like you said. kept starting and deleting. but i kept thinking about it anyway. like when i'm driving to work, or sitting at my desk pretending to care about emails.\n\nand i think... i don't know. i think i want to feel like i'm helping people. actually helping, not just going through motions at a job that doesn't care if i'm there or not. i used to volunteer stuff in college. community center type things. haven't done that in forever. somewhere along the way i just stopped.\n\nthe project's still there. got through maybe another hour of it yesterday. still slow but at least it's moving. my manager seems less stressed which is weird because now i'm waiting for the other team and there's literally nothing i can do until they send their stuff. but also kind of relieved? like at least i'm doing *something* now.\n\nsleep's been better. not perfect but not waking up at 3am every night. maybe because some of the pressure feeling lifted a little.\n\nanyway. what does it mean that i used to do that stuff and just... stopped? like is that normal or am i just broken.",
      "assistant": "**You got closer to the answer:**\nYou said you couldn't write it down because you kept starting and deleting\u2014but then it kept coming up while you were driving, sitting at your desk, living your life. That *is* the answer working its way to the surface: wanting to help people, actually help, not just perform helping at a job that wouldn't notice if you disappeared. The volunteering at the community center\u2014that mattered to you. It's still there in your memory because it meant something real.\n\n**\"What does it mean that I just stopped?\"**\nIt doesn't mean you're broken. It means life got busy, work ate up your time and energy, and somewhere in the four years of treading water, the things that actually mattered to you got crowded out by the things that paid the bills. That's not abnormal\u2014it's incredibly common. But common doesn't mean it's okay, and noticing it now means you get to ask: do I want to keep living like this, or do I want to make space for the stuff that actually feels like it matters?\n\nHere's what I'm curious about: when you think about doing that kind of work again\u2014helping people in a community center type way\u2014what comes up? Is it \"I want that but I don't have time,\" or is it something else? Because you don't have to rebuild your whole life overnight. You could start with two hours on a Saturday. Test if that thing still lights you up or if it's just nostalgia for who you used to be.\n\n**The project:**\nAnother hour yesterday, slow but moving\u2014that's real progress. And yeah, now you're waiting on the other team, so the pressure's off you for a bit. The relief you're feeling makes sense: you proved to yourself you can do the thing, and now there's a legitimate reason to pause. Your manager being less stressed probably means she saw you actually engage with it and stopped worrying you'd ghost the whole thing. You doing *something* changed her anxiety, even if that something was small.\n\n**Sleep's better:**\nNot waking up at 3am every night is a real shift. Some of the pressure lifted because you stopped avoiding the project entirely, and maybe also because you're starting to name the real thing underneath it all\u2014the \"is this worth it\" question. Your nervous system has something to do with that question now besides just spin on it in the dark."

      "user": "been thinking about the volunteering thing a lot. like way more than i expected. looked up a couple places near me. there's a crisis text line that needs people and a food bank. both seem like actual helping, not just... i don't know, performative stuff.\n\nbut then i got in my head about it. like if i'm only doing it because i feel empty at my job, is that the right reason? shouldn't i want to help people for like, the actual helping part, not because i'm running away from my life? feels like maybe i'd just be trading one avoidance thing for another.\n\nalso my mom called yesterday. first time she's reached out in like two weeks. asked how work was going and i almost told her about the whole treading water thing but chickened out. she'd just say \"you should be grateful you have a job\" or something. so we talked about her stuff instead. she's fine. everything's fine with her.\n\nthe project deadline's still three weeks away but the other team still hasn't sent their stuff. part of me thinks maybe they won't and then there's literally nothing i can do. which would be kind of perfect actually.\n\nsleep's still okay though. that part's actually getting better.",
      "assistant": "**The volunteering research:**\nYou looked up actual places\u2014crisis text line, food bank\u2014and they both feel like real helping, not performative. That's not nothing. You're taking the thing that's been circling in your head and testing it against reality. But then your mind jumped in with \"are my reasons good enough?\" Here's the thing: there's no such thing as a pure reason for helping people. Everyone who volunteers is getting something out of it\u2014connection, purpose, meaning, distraction from their own stuff. The crisis text line doesn't care *why* you showed up; they care that you did. And the person getting food at the food bank isn't going to be less helped because you also happen to be running from an empty job.\n\nYou're not trading one avoidance for another. Avoidance is staying on the couch, not opening the files, letting the question \"is this worth it\" eat you alive at 3am. Going toward something that might actually matter to you\u2014even if the motivation is messy\u2014that's the opposite of avoidance. That's you trying to build a life that feels less like treading water.\n\nWhat if you picked one\u2014just one\u2014and signed up for an info session or orientation? Not committing to forever, just gathering real information about what it would actually be like. Then you're working with data instead of your brain's story about whether your reasons are good enough.\n\n**Your mom:**\nYou almost told her the real thing\u2014the treading water feeling, the emptiness, the bigger question\u2014and then you pulled back because you predicted her response: \"you should be grateful you have a job.\" So instead you listened to her stuff, kept it surface-level, everything's fine. That's a choice you made to protect yourself from a conversation that wouldn't help. That's fair. But I'm also noticing: you wanted to tell her. Some part of you wanted to be seen in this, and you chose someone who you knew wouldn't see it. What would it be like to tell someone who *could* actually hear it\u2014a friend, someone who knows what it's like to feel stuck?\n\n**The project deadline + the other team:**\nYou're still waiting, and part of you is hoping they just... don't deliver, so the whole thing becomes not your problem. \"Which would be kind of perfect actually.\" I get the appeal\u2014problem solves itself, you're off the hook, no one can blame you. But also: is that what you actually want, or is that just the path of least resistance? Because if they *do* send their stuff and you have to finish this thing in a crunch, you'll be right back in the stress spiral. And if they *don't*, you're still stuck in the same job feeling the same way about your life, just without this particular project hanging over you.\n\n**Sleep:**\nThis is the second exchange where you've said sleep's getting better. That's real. Something's shifting\u2014maybe it's the volunteering idea giving your brain something to move toward instead of just something to run from, maybe it's you starting to name the real questions out loud. Either way, your nervous system is getting some relief. Keep doing the writing thing when you need it, but also notice: you're sleeping better because you're not just sitting with the dread anymore. You're doing something."

      "assistant": "**You signed up:**\nYou didn't just think about it or research it more\u2014you actually signed up. Training's next weekend. That's a real commitment, and it sounds like part of you is genuinely excited about it even though another part is spinning worst-case scenarios about saying the wrong thing. Here's what I want to reflect back: you looked at the training materials and something clicked. \"Teaching you how to actually listen, not just give advice\"\u2014that resonated because it's real, not performative. It's the opposite of the corporate checkbox life you've been living. And yeah, you might be nervous or even mess up in training, but that's what training is for. They're not expecting you to show up perfect; they're expecting you to show up willing to learn.\n\nThe fear about being terrible at it\u2014can you say more about what that would mean to you? Like if you did say the wrong thing in a practice scenario, what's the story your mind tells about what that would prove?\n\n**Not telling anyone yet:**\nYou're half excited, half terrified, and you haven't told anyone. That makes sense\u2014it's new, it's vulnerable, and you're still figuring out if it's real for you or just another thing that'll fizzle out. But also: you told me. So some part of you wants to be seen in this. When you imagine telling a friend\u2014not your mom, but someone who'd actually get it\u2014what stops you?\n\n**Work/project:**\nIt's still there, still moving slowly, still in a holding pattern waiting on the other team. But the big shift is this: \"it's not the thing that wakes me up anymore.\" That's huge. The project went from the impossible thing eating you alive at 3am to just... a thing you're doing. It's still slow, it's still not exciting, but it's not the center of your anxiety anymore. Something else is taking up that space now\u2014something you actually chose.\n\n**Your mom:**\nYou predicted exactly what she'd say\u2014\"that's nice, but why aren't you focusing on getting promoted?\"\u2014so you didn't tell her. Same pattern as last time: protecting yourself from a conversation that wouldn't help. And that's fair. But I'm also noticing you keep bringing her up, and you keep not telling her the real stuff. Is there something you're hoping for from her that you're not getting, or is this just you narrating the distance?\n\n**Sleep:**\nOnce a week instead of every night. That's a massive shift. Your nervous system is settling because you're not just sitting in the dread anymore\u2014you're moving toward something that might actually matter.

      "assistant": "**The training:**\nYou showed up, practiced actual conversations, and didn't bomb\u2014that's not nothing. And the feedback you got? \"Naturally empathetic\" landed weird because it doesn't match how you see yourself, but the facilitator saw something real. She also caught that you jump to fixing instead of listening, which is worth noticing. That impulse to fix\u2014does it show up other places in your life?

That's real, and it sounds like part of you is genuinely excited about it even as another part is questioning whether it's a mistake.\n\n**\"Am I just being impulsive / running away again\":**\nLet's slow down here. You're asking if adding the crisis text line to your life is impulsive\u2014but you've been thinking about this for weeks. You researched it, sat with the question of what you want your life to be about, signed up for training, went to the training, got feedback, and then committed to shifts. That's not impulsive. That's deliberate. Impulsive would be signing up in a panic at 3am and ghosting the training.\n\nAnd \"running away\"\u2014running away from what, exactly? The job that makes you feel like you're treading water? Yeah, you're running away from that feeling by running *toward* something that might actually matter to you. That's not avoidance\u2014that's you trying to build a life that doesn't feel empty. The fact that the job still sucks doesn't mean the volunteering is a mistake. It means you're doing something that might give you a reason to care about your time again while you figure out what to do about the job.\n\nHere's the real question: when you imagine yourself on that first shift in two weeks, what comes up? Dread, or something else?\n\n**\"I'm already drowning, why am I adding more\":**\nOne evening a week isn't going to drown you. But I hear the fear: \"I can't handle what I already have, so how can I handle more?\" Except you *are* handling what you have\u2014the project's moving, you're sleeping better, you're not waking up in a panic every night. You're not drowning. You're overwhelmed right now because the other team finally sent their stuff and the deadline just became real again. That's a spike in pressure, not proof that you can't handle the crisis text line.\n\nBut also: what if the volunteering actually helps? What if having one thing in your week that feels meaningful makes the job easier to tolerate because it's not the only thing defining your life anymore?\n\n**The other team sent their stuff:**\nYeah. Three weeks just became real instead of theoretical. The thing you've been avoiding and slowly chipping away at now has a hard deadline, and your sleep took a hit again the last two nights. That makes sense\u2014the pressure's back on. But here's what's different from a month ago: you've already proven you can work on this thing. You opened the files, read the documentation, put in time even when it was hard. You're not starting from zero. You're starting from \"I've done pieces of this and I know it's not impossible.\"\n\nWhat specifically are you dreading about the next three weeks? Is it the work itself, or is it something else\u2014like failing publicly, or your manager being disappointed, or proving to yourself that you're not capable?\n\n**Feeling overwhelmed:**\nEverything is happening at once: the project deadline is real, the volunteering is starting, the job still feels empty, your brain is asking \"are these good choices or am I spiraling?\" That's a lot. But let's separate the threads. The project: real, finite, has an end date in three weeks. The volunteering: one evening a week, something you chose, starts after the project's already due. These aren't piling on top of each other as much as your brain is making them feel like they are.\n\nOne thing that might help this week: write down what you actually need to do for the project between now and the deadline. Not \"finish the project\" as one giant thing, but the actual pieces. Break it into small enough chunks that you can see what three weeks of work actually looks like. Sometimes overwhelm comes from the brain inflating the thing into something bigger than it is. Give it real data."

      "assistant": "**Breaking down the project:**\nA third done already\u2014that's real progress. You took the giant overwhelming thing, broke it into actual pieces, and now you can see it's doable if you focus. That shift from \"impossible\" to \"doable if I focus\" is huge. And you're already a third through. The breaking-it-down thing worked because it gave your brain real data instead of just dread.\n\n**Friends disappearing:**\nYou looked up from your desk and realized you haven't talked to your friends in two weeks\u2014people you used to be close with. And now you're \"gone from their lives I guess.\" That hits different than just being busy. It sounds like you're noticing a pattern of withdrawal, and it's landing as loss. When you think about reaching out to one of them\u2014just one text to someone you used to talk to regularly\u2014what comes up? Is it \"I don't have the energy,\" or is it something else, like shame about disappearing, or fear they've moved on without you?\n\nAnd you're right\u2014volunteering one night a week won't fix the friend thing. But also, you don't need to fix all of it at once. What if you picked one person this week and sent them something small? Not an apology for disappearing, not an explanation\u2014just \"hey, been thinking about you, how are you?\" and see what happens. Sometimes reconnecting is easier than your brain makes it seem.\n\n**The jump-to-fix pattern:**\nYou're connecting the dots now. \"Naturally empathetic\" but also always jumping to fix\u2014with your friends when they vent, with your mom, probably with everyone. And then you landed on something big: \"wonder if that's why I'm so exhausted all the time. trying to fix everything and everyone and obviously failing at most of it.\" Yeah. That'll do it. Carrying everyone's problems as your responsibility, trying to solve them all, and then feeling like a failure when you can't\u2014that's a recipe for exhaustion and emptiness.\n\nHere's what I'm curious about: what would it feel like to just listen to a friend vent without trying to fix it? Like actually try it once\u2014when someone shares something hard, resist the urge to solve it and just say \"that sounds really hard\" or \"I'm sorry you're dealing with that.\" See what happens. It might feel uncomfortable at first, like you're not doing enough, but it also might feel like relief. You don't have to carry everyone's stuff. Sometimes just being there is the whole thing.\n\n**10 days until volunteering starts:**\nStill nervous but also looking forward to it. That mix makes sense\u2014it's new, it's real, it matters to you. And you noticed something important: \"i'm supposed to be drowning but somehow i'm not.\" You're not drowning. You've got a project that's a third done, sleep that's decent, volunteering coming up that you actually care about, and you're starting to see patterns in yourself that might explain the exhaustion. That's not drowning. That's you building something."

The fact that it was \"a lot\" makes sense\u2014you've been isolating without realizing it, and his response made that isolation visible. You weren't just busy; you disappeared from people who notice when you're gone.\n\nCoffee this weekend: yeah, it feels terrifying because you're worried you won't know what to say or that things will be different now. But here's the thing\u2014Derek already knows you disappeared. He asked about it. So you don't have to hide it or perform like everything's been fine. What if you just told him some version of the truth? Not \"sorry I spiraled,\" but maybe \"I've been in my head a lot lately, trying to figure some stuff out. It's good to see you.\" You don't owe him a full explanation, but you also don't have to pretend.

She asked about work, you almost brought up the \"is this worth it\" thing, and then she started talking about her own stuff\u2014and you let her.

Was it that she actually got to talk, or was it that you didn't have to perform for her?\n\n**Volunteering starts this week:**\n\"Still nervous but like, ready?\" Yeah. That sounds right.

      "assistant": "**Coffee with Derek:**\nTen minutes of awkward and then you fell back into it\u2014that's exactly how reconnection works. It's not instant, but it also doesn't stay weird forever. And he noticed something real: \"dude you sound burnt out.\" He's seeing what you've been living with, and instead of judging it or telling you to be grateful for your job, he just named it. That's what it looks like when someone actually hears you. You said yes to beers next week before you could overthink it\u2014that's you choosing connection instead of isolation. Keep doing that.\n\n**The volunteering shift:**\nYou did your first shift. Technically fine\u2014answered calls, listened, said the right things. But then you came home with that heaviness, replaying the conversation with the person who talked about wanting to hurt themselves, spiraling on \"what if they didn't get help, what if I made it worse.\" That's not a small thing to carry. And now you're asking yourself if you can keep doing this when your own life already feels like too much broken stuff.\n\nHere's what I want to reflect back: the heaviness you're feeling isn't proof that you're bad at this or that you made it worse. It's proof that you care. The person on the other end wasn't looking for you to fix them or save them\u2014they were looking for someone to listen without judgment, and you did that. You can't control what they do after the call ends. That's not your job. Your job was to be present while they were talking to you, and it sounds like you were.\n\nThe facilitator's right that this is normal when you're new\u2014you don't have the calluses yet, so everything lands harder. But I also want to ask: what specifically are you afraid of here? Is it that you'll carry this heaviness every time and burn out, or is it something else\u2014like you'll fail someone in a way that matters, or you're not strong enough to handle other people's pain when you're already struggling with your own?\n\nOne thing that might help: after your next shift, try writing down what happened\u2014not to solve it or fix it, but just to get it out of your head and onto paper. Same thing that helped with the 3am wake-ups. Your brain's trying to process something heavy, and sometimes it just needs a place to put it down instead of carrying it all night.\n\n**\"Taking on more broken stuff when my own life is already...\":**\nI hear you saying your own life feels broken, and now you're adding other people's brokenness on top of it. But I want to push back a little: your life isn't as broken as it felt a month ago. You're sleeping better, the project's almost done, you're reconnecting with Derek, you broke the isolation pattern. You're still figuring out the \"is this worth it\" question about your job, but you're not drowning anymore. You're building something.\n\nThat said\u2014if the volunteering feels like it's pulling you under instead of giving you something meaningful, you're allowed to step back. You don't have to white-knuckle through something that's making your life worse just because you committed to it. But give it a few more shifts before you decide. Right now you're one shift in, carrying the heaviness of the first hard call. That's not enough data to know if this is sustainable or not. See how it feels after three or four shifts, once some of the newness wears off.\n\n**Project's almost done:**\nThree weeks compressed to ten days, and you're on the other side of it. Your manager said good job. That thing that felt impossible a month ago\u2014that you avoided, that kept you up at 3am, that you were convinced you couldn't do\u2014you did it. And it sounds like you're surprised by that. What does it feel like to have actually finished something that felt impossible?"

You're doing something real, and your system is adapting to handle it. That matters.\n\n**Derek and the real conversation:**\nYou told him some of it. Not everything, but enough. And it felt good to stop pretending everything's fine. That's what actual connection looks like\u2014not performing, not fixing, just being honest about where you actually are. And he showed up for that. You're rebuilding something that matters, and it sounds like it's working.\n\n**The project shipped:**\nDone. Actually done. Manager happy, team happy, you didn't screw it up. The thing that felt impossible six weeks ago\u2014that kept you up at 3am, that you avoided opening files for\u2014you proved you could do it. The relief makes sense. You carried that weight for a long time, and now it's gone. But there's something else in there too: \"proved something to myself I guess, even though I'm not totally sure what.\" What do you think you proved? That you're capable of hard things? That the dread is bigger than the actual work? That you can handle pressure when it's real?\n\n**The bigger question is still there:**\nYeah. The crisis passed\u2014project's done, volunteering's manageable, sleep's better, you're reconnecting with people\u2014and now you're back to the thing underneath it all: the job still feels empty. The money's fine, but is this what you want to do for the next however many years? That question was always there. The project just gave you something else to focus on for a while. Now the noise is gone and the question is sitting there, quieter but still real.\n\nYou're asking if you need to figure out a whole new career, and that feels huge and impossible. Or maybe you're supposed to accept that work is just the thing that pays the bills and find meaning elsewhere\u2014but volunteering one night a week and beers with Derek aren't enough to sustain you. Both of those options feel incomplete, right? Like neither one actually solves the problem.\n\nHere's what I'm noticing: you're framing this as an either/or. Either blow up your whole career (huge, impossible), or resign yourself to emptiness and try to patch it with meaning on the side (not enough). But there might be other options you're not seeing yet because you're still thinking in extremes. What if the question isn't \"new career or accept this forever,\" but something smaller and more exploratory? Like: what would make *this* job feel less empty? Is it the work itself that's the problem, or is it the environment, the people, the lack of growth, the feeling that it doesn't matter? Because if it's not the work itself, maybe the move isn't \"find a whole new career\" but \"find a different version of this work somewhere that doesn't make you feel like you're treading water.\"\n\nOr maybe it *is* the work itself, and you need to do something totally different. But you don't have to know that yet. You're allowed to explore without committing to a massive life overhaul.\n\nHere's something to try: imagine it's a year from now and you're telling someone about your life. In that version, what's different about how you spend your days that makes you feel like it's worth it? Not \"I have a new career\" or \"I accepted my fate\"\u2014just what's actually different in your day-to-day that makes you feel less like you're wasting time. Maybe it's the type of work, maybe it's the people you work with, maybe it's having more time for things outside work, maybe it's learning something new. Just notice what comes up when you sit with that.\n\nYou don't have to solve this all at once. The project felt impossible too, and you broke it into pieces and worked through it. This is the same thing\u2014just bigger and slower. You've already proven you can do hard things. This is just the next one."

Energy left over to actually do things instead of just work and collapse. Reading, walks, not running on empty. That's real, and it's telling you something important: the problem might not be what you're doing for work, but how much of yourself it's taking. \"I need to not be completely drained by the end of the day\" isn't about living wrong\u2014it's about recognizing that the current setup is unsustainable, and something has to shift.\n\nHere's what I'm curious about: what's draining you? Is it the volume of work, the type of work, the environment, the people, the lack of boundaries? Because if you can name what's actually taking all your energy, you might be able to change pieces of it without blowing up your whole life. Maybe it's saying no to things like mentoring someone when you're already exhausted. Maybe it's setting better boundaries around work hours. Maybe it's realizing this job will never give you the space you need and starting to look elsewhere\u2014but not in a panic, just as an option worth exploring.\n\n**The mentoring thing:**\nYour manager asked if you want to mentor someone, you were flattered but mostly thought \"no I'm already exhausted,\" and then you said you'd think about it instead of just saying no. Yeah, you're probably going to regret that. Here's the pattern: you proved you could handle the hard project, so now she's offering you more responsibility, and part of you wants to say yes because it feels like recognition\u2014but the rest of you knows you don't have the bandwidth. You don't owe her a yes just because she asked. \"I'm flattered, but I don't have the capacity right now\" is a complete sentence. You're allowed to protect your energy, especially when you just told yourself you need more time and space, not less.\n\nWhat would it feel like to actually say no to her? Not \"I'll think about it\" as a soft no, but just \"I can't take that on right now\"?\n\n**The trip with Derek:**\nPlanning something real instead of just \"we should hang out sometime\"\u2014that's you choosing connection again. And yeah, it's terrifying because you're worried you won't follow through or it'll be awkward once you're stuck together for a few days. But you've already rebuilt the friendship enough that he wants to spend a few days with you. The awkwardness at coffee lasted ten minutes and then it wasn't awkward anymore. You're catastrophizing a trip that hasn't happened yet based on a fear that didn't come true last time. What if it's just... good? What if you actually have fun and it reminds you what it feels like to not be drained all the time?\n\n**Volunteering:**\nHard calls this week, but they don't destroy you after anymore.

Like financially, logistically, what would part-time or better boundaries actually look like? You don't have to have answers yet, but it's worth sitting with. Could you afford to go part-time at your current job? Is there a different kind of work that's less draining even if it's full-time? Are there jobs in helping fields\u2014like the kind of work you're doing with the crisis text line\u2014that would feel less like treading water because they actually matter to you?\n\nYou don't have to solve this right now.

Like actually imagine the conversation: you tell her you're thinking about working less so you have more time for things that matter. What does she say in that version, and what does that make you feel?\n\nYou keep bringing her up, and you keep not telling her the real stuff. At some point that's a choice worth examining. Are you protecting yourself from her reaction, or are you protecting her from knowing you're struggling, or is it something else?\n\n**Sleep:**\nOnce every couple weeks now, if that. That's a massive shift from waking up every night at 3am six weeks ago. Your nervous system has settled because you're not just sitting in the dread anymore\u2014you're moving toward something, setting boundaries, reconnecting, building a life that feels less empty.

That's how you move from stuck to unstuck: one search, one conversation, one small step that makes the thing less abstract.\n\n**Derek's reaction:**\n\"Dude you hate your job, why are you still there?\" He just named what you've been living with for months, and it landed differently this time because you're ready to hear it. But here's the thing that really shifted: you realized you've been treating the job like it's permanent when it's actually a choice you're making every day. That's not a small realization. You're not trapped. You're stuck until you figure out what's next\u2014and figuring out what's next is already happening. You're looking at nonprofit positions, you're exploring what working less might look like, you're building a life outside work that actually matters. That's progress, not just optimism.\n\n**Volunteering becoming the thing you look forward to:**\nThe hard calls don't scare you anymore, and this week you had one where the person seemed better after\u2014or at least less alone\u2014and you couldn't stop thinking about it in a good way. That's what it feels like when you do something that actually matters. Not going through motions, not checking boxes, but genuinely helping someone in a moment when they needed it. You felt like you actually did something. That's the opposite of the emptiness you've been describing at work. Pay attention to that difference. It's telling you what kind of work might actually sustain you.\n\n**Your mom:**\nYou keep bringing her up, you keep not calling her, and now you're asking \"what's the point.\" You're predicting she'll worry or call you impulsive, so it's easier to just not say anything. I hear you protecting yourself from a conversation that probably wouldn't help. But I'm also noticing this is the fourth or fifth time you've mentioned her, and every time it's the same pattern: \"I didn't tell her\" + a reason why. At some point, that repetition is worth looking at. What are you hoping for from her that you're not getting? Is there a part of you that wants her to see you in this\u2014to witness the changes, to validate the risk, to say \"I'm proud of you for figuring this out\"? Or is it something else, like you just wish she could hear you without making it about her worry or her ideas of what you should do?\n\nYou don't have to call her. But the fact that she keeps coming up in your head suggests there's something unresolved there. Maybe it's not about actually telling her\u2014maybe it's about grieving that she's not the person who can hold this with you, and finding people who can. Derek's already doing that. He heard \"I hate my job\" and didn't tell you to be grateful\u2014he asked why you're still there. That's what support looks like. You're allowed to let your mom off the hook for being someone she's not, and invest in the people who actually show up for you.\n\n**Sleep and work:**\nSleep's still good. Work still sucks, but it's different now\u2014you're not trapped, just stuck until you figure out what's next. And figuring out what's next is already in motion. That's absolutely progress. You went from \"is this worth it\" as a question that kept you up at 3am to \"here are nonprofit jobs I could apply for\" and \"I'm not trapped, I'm choosing this until I choose something else.\" That's agency. You're building toward something instead of just enduring."
