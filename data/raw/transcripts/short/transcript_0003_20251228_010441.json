The whole team is stretched thin and my manager keeps adding more to my plate like I'm some kind of machine. Typical corporate nonsense. I've been in this industry 30 years, you'd think I'd be used to it by now.\n\nAnyway my daughter called yesterday which was nice I suppose. She lives across the country now. Everyone does. My son barely texts back, my husband passed three years ago, and most of my old friends have drifted away or moved. The house feels very quiet most days.\n\nBut yes the work thing. I just need to get through next week and then things should calm down. Probably.",

Was there something bittersweet about it, or are you just not sure how to feel about these calls when she's so far away?\n\n**The quiet house:** This felt like the heavier thing underneath. Husband gone three years, son distant, friends scattered\u2014that's a lot of absence to sit with, especially when work stress fills the day and then you come home to silence. You mentioned it almost in passing, but I don't want to skip past it. Is the loneliness something you've found ways to manage, or does it mostly just... sit there?"

Still have a mountain to get through but at least nobody's breathing down my neck every five minutes.\n\nI tried calling my son on Sunday. Went to voicemail, he texted back like four hours later saying he was busy. Always busy. I know he has his own life, I'm not one of those mothers who expects daily calls or whatever. But a ten minute conversation once a month doesn't seem unreasonable. I remember when my mother was his age I called her every week. Different generation I suppose.\n\nThe daughter thing, you asked about that. It was fine. We talked about her job mostly, she's doing well. I don't know if it's bittersweet, that's your word. It's just... it ends and then I'm back to the quiet. The call is nice and then it's over and I'm sitting there with my tea wondering what the point of any of this is anymore. Not in a dramatic way, just like a practical observation. Work, eat, sleep, repeat. The weekends are worse actually. At least work gives me something to do.",

Sounds like you're through the worst of it.\n\n**Your son:** You're being pretty reasonable about this: you're not asking for daily check-ins, just basic connection. The comparison to how you were with your mother\u2014that's hard. You held up your end of that generational contract, and it stings when it doesn't come back. Have you ever told him directly that you'd like to talk more, or does it feel like that shouldn't need saying?\n\n**The quiet after the call:** This is the part I want to sit with. You said \"what's the point of any of this anymore\"\u2014and you qualified it as practical, not dramatic, but I don't think the distinction matters much. That feeling of just... going through motions. Work fills the weekdays, but weekends lay it bare.\n\nHere's what I'm hearing underneath: the loneliness isn't just about missing people, it's about meaning. When your husband was alive, when the kids were closer, the daily routine pointed toward something. Now the structure is still there but the purpose drained out of it.\n\nIs that close? And if so\u2014what used to give you that sense of meaning, back when things felt more full? Not asking you to recreate it, just curious what it looked like."

Seemed pointless to grow tomatoes for one person.\n\nWork update since you asked last time, things are actually getting worse again. They moved the deadline up by a week because the client changed scope. Classic. I told my manager this was unrealistic and she just said \"we'll make it work\" which is corporate speak for \"you'll figure it out and I'll take credit.\" I've seen this movie before.\n\nHad lunch with a former coworker yesterday. First time I've done anything social in... I don't actually remember. Months probably. She kept talking about her grandchildren and her upcoming cruise and I just sat there nodding. Felt like I was watching from outside myself. Like I was playing a role. \"Deepa at lunch, pretending to be a person who has a life.\" That's probably too dramatic, I don't mean it like that. It was fine. She's nice enough.\n\nI did think about what you said. About the loneliness being about meaning. I think you might be overcomplicating it though. Sometimes empty is just empty. My husband is dead, my kids are gone, and I go to work. That's just the situation. I don't need it to mean something.",
      "assistant": "**Work getting worse:** The deadline moving up while scope expands\u2014that's not just frustrating, it's genuinely unfair. And your manager's \"we'll make it work\" is exactly what you named it: she's offloading her problem onto you. You've been doing this thirty years, you know how it ends. What I'm wondering is whether there's any version of pushing back harder, or if the cost of that fight isn't worth it at this point in your career.\n\n**The lunch:** You went. That's notable\u2014first social thing in months, and you did it. But what you're describing, that feeling of watching yourself from outside, performing \"Deepa at lunch\"... that's not nothing. It's not dramatic either. It's what happens when you're disconnected from your own life for long enough that even showing up somewhere feels like acting.\n\n**The garden:** You mentioned it almost as a throwaway\u2014\"used to garden, haven't in two years, seemed pointless for one person.\" But you grew vegetables for years. That wasn't just about the tomatoes. Something shifted when it became just you, and the garden became a reminder of that.\n\n**On meaning:** Fair enough. You're pushing back on my framing, and I hear you\u2014sometimes empty is just the accurate description of a situation. I'm not going to argue with you about whether your life needs to *mean* something.\n\nBut here's what I notice: you said \"what's the point of any of this\" and then you listed things that used to matter\u2014the garden, being connected, not feeling like you're performing your own life. You're not asking me for meaning. You're telling me what's missing.\n\nSo maybe the question isn't about finding some grand purpose. Maybe it's smaller: is there anything\u2014even one thing\u2014that you'd actually *want* back? Not because it's good for you or because you should. Just because you miss it."

My back is killing me from sitting at that desk for ten hours straight. The client keeps requesting changes and my manager keeps saying yes to everything without consulting the team. I'm too old for this honestly. Twenty more months until I can retire with full benefits and I'm counting every single one.\n\nThe coworker I had lunch with texted asking if I wanted to do it again. I haven't responded. It's been three days. I should probably say something. She was perfectly pleasant, there's no reason not to. I just can't seem to make myself care enough to type out a reply. Everything feels like effort lately. Getting out of bed, making dinner, responding to texts. Even this, talking to you. Not that it's not helpful I suppose. It's just... heavy. All of it.\n\nAnyway my son actually called. Out of nowhere. Wanted to ask about his grandmother's china set, whether I still had it. Apparently his girlfriend collects vintage dishware or something. We talked for maybe seven minutes total and then he had to go. So that happened.",

Twenty more months. You're counting them because that's what's getting you through. I'm not going to tell you to find joy in the journey or whatever. Sometimes you just survive until the finish line.

But you can't make yourself care enough to type it out. That's the part that stands out to me. It's not that you don't want to see her. It's that everything requires effort you don't have. Getting up, making dinner, responding, even talking to me. You said \"heavy.\" That word is doing a lot of work.\n\nI want to name something carefully: when *everything* feels like effort\u2014when basic things that used to be automatic now require pushing through\u2014that's not just loneliness or grief or a bad stretch at work. That's something worth paying attention to. Not in an alarming way. But the weight you're describing sounds like it's been accumulating for a while. Has it always been this heavy, or has it gotten heavier recently?\n\n**Your son's call:** Seven minutes about china for his girlfriend. He called, which is something. But I imagine it also stung a little\u2014or maybe a lot\u2014that *that's* what prompted him to pick up the phone. Not to check on you. To ask about dishes. You don't have to feel any particular way about it. I'm just noticing you reported it pretty flatly: \"so that happened.\"\n\nWhat was it actually like to hang up?"

Thirty years and I still can't believe how these things go.\n\nOn the bright side I suppose I'm not pulling fourteen hour days anymore. So there's that.\n\nI did respond to the text finally. My former coworker. Told her I'd been slammed at work which wasn't a lie exactly. We're getting coffee next Tuesday.

I imagine there's some bitter vindication mixed in with the exhaustion. But also: you're not pulling fourteen-hour days anymore. Your body gets a break. That's not nothing, even if the way you got there was infuriating.\n\n**The coffee Tuesday:** You responded. You said yes. You're going even though you don't particularly want to.

It's not \"just how things are now.\" It's something that happens to people who've been carrying grief and isolation and exhaustion for a long time without support.\n\nYou don't have to unpack your childhood. Therapy at 57 isn't about excavating the past unless you want it to be. Sometimes it's just having someone to talk to who isn't a coworker making small talk about cruises. Someone where you don't have to perform. You're already doing a version of that here.\n\nI'm not telling you what to do. You're 57, you've been handling your own life for decades.

At least I don't have that problem.\n\nThat was a joke. Sort of.\n\nI've been thinking about what you said about therapy. I looked up a few names, didn't call anyone. Just looked. There's a woman who does telehealth for people \"in life transitions\" which I suppose describes me if you squint. Probably won't do anything about it but I looked.

The dark humor about the empty house, the way grief shows up sideways. You can make that joke with me.\n\n**Looking up therapists:** You looked. You didn't call, but you looked. That's not nothing\u2014that's actually something. The woman who does telehealth for \"life transitions\"... you're right, that does describe you if you squint. And if you never call, you never call. But the fact that you went searching means part of you is wondering if there's something there. You don't have to decide anything. The names aren't going anywhere.\n\n**Work limbo:** Downtime that doesn't feel like rest\u2014just empty hours performing busyness while your manager lines up the next thing for you to grind through. That in-between space is strange. Not quite relief, not quite boredom. Just waiting for the next wave. Is there anything you'd actually *want* to do with the downtime if you didn't have to perform being busy?\n\n**The spring visit:** This is where I want to slow down. Your daughter is trying\u2014sending restaurant links, making plans. You can see it. And your response to that effort is: \"I don't know if I have the energy to be a good houseguest.\"\n\nThere's a lot packed in there. The flight, the performing cheerfulness, looking at her nice life with all her plants and then coming back to the quiet house\u2014which might feel *worse* after seeing what she's built. That last part feels like the real fear. Not the exhaustion of travel. The contrast. Visiting someone who has a full life and then returning to one that feels empty.\n\nBut here's the other thing: you said she's trying. And you're thinking about it. You didn't say no. \n\nWhat if you didn't have to be a good houseguest? What if you could just be a tired mom who shows up, looks at her plants, eats at her restaurants, and doesn't perform?

It makes sense to set it down while work is demanding this much of you. It's not a closed door, just a paused one. If it helps at all, some therapists have sliding scales that aren't listed on their websites\u2014might be worth one email asking, if you find someone whose bio actually resonates. But that's for later, when the bandwidth exists.\n\n**Work and Monday's \"check-in\":** You already know what's coming, and you're preparing your case.

Getting something documented? Just surviving it?\n\n**Book club:** A room full of strangers discussing a book you haven't read does sound like a lot of performing. You know yourself. But I'll say this: you thought the coffee would be nodding through grandchildren stories, and it turned into something better. You don't have to decide now. \"I'll think about it\" buys you time until you see how the next few weeks feel.\n\n**The closet:** You said once was enough, you don't see the point, it's been three years, you have to stop looking backward.

Waking up at 3am, can't fall back asleep, just lying there thinking about nothing and everything. Been happening for a couple weeks now. Probably just stress from the project. It'll pass once things calm down.",
      "assistant": "**Monday's check-in:** You held your ground. You got it on record. That's not a small victory\u2014that's exactly what you said you wanted going in. She did her performance, you did yours, and you walked out with documentation that the timeline was her problem, not your failure. In a system that won't change, protecting yourself on paper is the smart move.\n\n**Your son:** \"Grab dinner or something.\" Yeah, I hear how that landed\u2014penciled in like a work contact. It stings that this is what it takes to get him to your city, that you're an afterthought to his business trip. And you said \"sure\" because what else would you say. You're not wrong. But I also notice: he texted. He's coming. You'll be sitting across from him at a table. That's more than a seven-minute phone call about china. It might be awkward, it might feel transactional, but it's something. What would you actually want that dinner to be, if you could have it go any way?\n\n**Book club:** You signed up. The book's on hold at the library. You're already framing it as \"practice for being around people\" before you see your daughter\u2014which is both self-aware and a little bit of a hedge. But you did it. You keep doing things you don't particularly want to do, and sometimes they turn out better than expected. Italy divorce novel isn't your thing, but you might have opinions about it anyway. That's usually enough for book club.\n\n**The sleep:** This is the one I want to pause on. You mentioned it almost as an afterthought\u2014\"oh also\"\u2014but waking up at 3am, lying there unable to fall back asleep, thinking about nothing and everything... that's been going on for a couple of weeks now. You're attributing it to project stress, and maybe that's part of it. But you've also been carrying a lot more than work lately: the son stuff, the box in the closet, the trip coming up, the heaviness you've described for months.\n\n3am wakeups that stick\u2014that's often when the things we push aside during the day find us. The mind gets quiet enough for everything else to surface.\n\nI'm not trying to make it into something bigger than it is. But \"probably stress, it'll pass\" is also how you've described a lot of things that have actually been weighing on you for a while. Is this a new pattern, or has sleep been rough since before the project ramped up?"

At least the pressure is off slightly. Still working weekends but not as late.\n\nThe sleep thing, you asked if it's new. I don't know. Maybe not. Now that I think about it I've been waking up early for a while, I just used to get up and do things. Read or whatever. Lately I just lie there. Too tired to get up, too awake to sleep. It's different I suppose. Or maybe I'm just noticing it more because everything else is harder.\n\nDinner with my son is next week. I keep rehearsing what I'm going to say which is ridiculous. He's my son, not a job interview. But I don't want it to be awkward silence the whole time and I feel like if I don't prepare I'll just ask about his job and nod for an hour. I used to know how to talk to him. When he was younger. Now it's like speaking to a polite stranger who happens to share my genetics.\n\nRead the first chapter of the book club book by the way. The Italy one. It's fine. Woman's husband leaves her for someone younger, she decides to reinvent herself abroad. Very predictable so far but easy enough to get through I suppose. At least I'll have something to say at the meeting.\n\nOh I did find another therapist who takes my insurance. Haven't called yet. Her bio mentions grief specifically which felt pointed somehow. Probably overthinking it. I'll get to it eventually.",
      "assistant": "**Work:** A client apology\u2014that's rare enough to be notable. And the pressure easing, even slightly, matters. Your manager trying to claim credit for \"managing expectations\" is predictable and irritating, but you already knew that's who she is. Still working weekends, but not as late. Incremental relief. Take it.\n\n**The sleep:** What you described is different from before, and you're naming it clearly now: you used to wake up early and get up, do things, read. Now you lie there\u2014too tired to move, too awake to rest. That in-between state, stuck in the dark with your thoughts. You said maybe you're noticing it more because everything else is harder. I think that's probably true. When you're running on fumes during the day, the 3am hours feel heavier. It's all connected\u2014the tiredness feeds the lying there, which feeds the tiredness. Not a crisis, but worth paying attention to. If it persists after the project pressure eases, that's data.\n\n**Dinner with your son:** You're rehearsing what to say to your own kid, and you know how absurd that feels. But I understand why. The gap between who he was\u2014someone you knew how to talk to\u2014and who he is now, this polite stranger you share DNA with, is painful. You're trying to bridge it with preparation because the alternative is sitting in awkward silence or defaulting to job questions and nodding.\n\nHere's a thought: what if you didn't try to fill the silence? What if you let a pause sit there and see what he does with it? You're carrying all the responsibility for making this dinner work. But connection is a two-way thing. You could also just... ask him something real. Not about work. Something like \"what's actually good in your life right now?\" and see if he can meet you there. He might not. But you'd learn something either way.\n\nWhat would you actually want to say to him if you weren't worried about how it would land?\n\n**Book club:** First chapter down, predictable Italy reinvention plot, but you'll have something to say. That's the assignment completed. You don't have to love the book\u2014you just have to show up with opinions. Sounds like you're on track.\n\n**The new therapist:** You found someone who takes your insurance. Her bio mentions grief, and that felt pointed. You said you're probably overthinking it\u2014but I don't think you are. It felt pointed because it *is* relevant. That's not the universe sending you a sign; it's just you recognizing a fit.\n\nYou said you'll get to it eventually. I believe you. But I'll also gently note: you've said that before, and then insurance got in the way, and then bandwidth got in the way. This one clears the insurance hurdle. The bandwidth will never be perfect. If there's a week where \"eventually\" becomes \"today,\" it might be worth noticing and acting on it. Not because you have to. Just because the window might be open right now in a way it wasn't before."

      "user": "So dinner with my son happened. It was fine. We talked about his job mostly, his girlfriend, the apartment they're looking at. I asked him what's actually good in his life like you suggested. He looked at me weird for a second and then said \"I don't know, things are good I guess, work is busy.\" Very illuminating. I tried not to fill all the silences but it's hard. He kept checking his phone. By the end we were both just kind of ready for it to be over I think. He hugged me goodbye though which was something.\n\nI called the therapist. The grief one. Appointment is next Thursday. Telehealth so I can do it from my office during lunch. I don't know what I'm going to say to her. \"Hi I'm fine but also everything is heavy and I can't sleep and my husband died three years ago and I'm counting days until I can retire and also until I visit my daughter, that's the update.\" She'll probably tell me I'm depressed which I already know. Or suspected anyway. Saying it out loud feels different.\n\nBook club is this weekend. Still only halfway through the book. The Italy lady just bought a villa which seems financially irresponsible but I suppose that's the fantasy. I'll finish it tomorrow probably.\n\nWork is the same. Nothing new there.",

And what you got back was \"things are good I guess, work is busy\" and him checking his phone. That's disappointing. Not because you expected a breakthrough, but because you showed up differently and he... didn't really meet you there. By the end you were both ready for it to be over. I get it.\n\nBut: he hugged you goodbye. You noted that. It was something. Maybe that's all this dinner was\u2014a small something in a relationship that's been mostly nothing for a while. Not the connection you wanted, but not pure transaction either. A hug is a data point. It doesn't fix the distance, but it's not nothing.\n\n**The therapist appointment:** You called. Thursday. That's real and it's happening. \n\nThe thing you said\u2014\"she'll probably tell me I'm depressed which I already know, or suspected anyway\"\u2014that landed. You've been circling this for a while, describing the heaviness, the effort everything takes, the 3am ceiling-staring, the performing your way through life. You've known. But you're right that saying it out loud feels different. There's something about hearing it named, in a room (even a virtual one) with another person, that makes it more real. Not worse\u2014just more acknowledged.\n\nYou don't have to walk in with a polished summary. \"Everything is heavy and I can't sleep and my husband died three years ago\" is actually a perfectly good opening. She'll take it from there. That's her job. Yours is just to show up, which you're already doing.\n\n**Book club:** Halfway through, Italy lady buying a financially irresponsible villa\u2014you'll finish it tomorrow, you'll have opinions, you'll show up Saturday.

      "user": "Thursday happened. The therapy thing. It was... I don't know. Strange. She asked a lot of questions, I gave a lot of answers. She didn't actually say the word depression which surprised me. She talked about \"prolonged grief\" and \"adjustment\" and how three years isn't that long when you've been with someone for thirty. I don't know if that made me feel better or worse. Both maybe.\n\nShe asked about the sleep and the heaviness and I told her what I've told you. She wants to meet weekly which seems like a lot but I said fine. Next Thursday same time. So I guess I'm doing this now.\n\nBook club was fine. The Italy villa lady ends up happy of course, finds herself, new love interest, very tidy. The other women seemed nice. One of them lost her husband too, about five years ago. We didn't talk about it much but there was a moment of recognition I guess. She invited me to coffee afterward but I was too tired so I said maybe next time. Probably should have said yes but I just wanted to go home.\n\nWork deadline got pushed which should be good news except now everything is in limbo. Waiting for client decisions, waiting for my manager to tell us the new plan. I hate the waiting almost more than the crunch honestly.\n\nDaughter keeps sending me articles about things to do in her city. Restaurants with good reviews, some botanical garden, a pottery class we could take together. Pottery. I haven't done anything like that in years. She's really building this up and I keep worrying I'm going to disappoint her somehow by just being tired and quiet the whole visit. The flight is in nineteen days.",
      "assistant": "**Therapy:** You went. You sat through the questions, you gave the answers. \"Prolonged grief\" and \"adjustment\" instead of the word you were bracing for\u2014and you're right, that can feel like both better and worse at the same time. Better because maybe it's not a label that flattens everything you're experiencing. Worse because \"three years isn't that long when you've been with someone for thirty\" means there's no finish line, no point where you're supposed to be \"over it.\"\n\nShe wants weekly. You said fine. You're doing this now. That's not a small thing, Deepa. You went from \"what would I even do\" to showing up on a Thursday and agreeing to come back. Whatever comes next, that's already movement.\n\n**Book club:** The Italy lady got her tidy ending\u2014of course she did. But the real thing that happened was that moment with the woman who lost her husband five years ago. You didn't talk about it much, but you recognized each other. That's a different kind of connection than complaining about industry stuff over coffee. She invited you out afterward and you were too tired. That's okay. You said maybe next time, and maybe next time you will. Or maybe you won't. But she asked, which means she saw something worth knowing better.\n\n**Work:** Deadline pushed, everything in limbo. You hate the waiting more than the crunch\u2014that tracks. At least crunch has momentum, direction, something to push against. Limbo is just sitting in uncertainty with no way to move it along. Not much to do except wait, which is its own kind of exhausting.\n\n**Your daughter and the trip:** Nineteen days. She's sending you botanical gardens and pottery classes and restaurant reviews. She's building it up because she wants it to be good\u2014for you, for her, for whatever your relationship is becoming now that you're both adults on opposite coasts.\n\nAnd you're worried you'll disappoint her by being tired and quiet.\n\nHere's what I want to offer: your daughter knows you. She knows Raj died. She probably knows, on some level, that you've been carrying something heavy even if you haven't named it. She's not sending you pottery class links because she expects you to be sparkling and energetic. She's sending them because she wants to spend time with you and she's trying to make it easy\u2014giving you options, building a structure so you don't have to.\n\nYou don't have to be anything other than what you are when you get there. Tired is allowed. Quiet is allowed. You might surprise yourself and have moments of not-tired, not-quiet. But even if the whole trip is just you sitting in her apartment looking at her plants and eating at her restaurants and being a mom who showed up\u2014that's not disappointment. That's presence. \n\nNineteen days. You're almost there."

      "user": "So therapy again yesterday. She asked about my support network which felt like a trick question. I listed you, my coworker, I guess the book club now. She nodded and wrote something down. I don't know what she expected me to say. I have people I talk to. It's not like I'm completely isolated.\n\nWork is still limbo. My manager is \"out of office\" all week which means nothing happens until she gets back. I've been doing busywork, reorganizing files, clearing old emails. Killing time basically. Sixteen more months until retirement now. I keep a little countdown on my phone which is probably pathetic but it helps.\n\nSecond therapy session was different from the first I think. She asked about Raj more directly. What was he like. How we met. I told her about the garden, how he built the raised beds one summer and then I took over planting and he'd just sit on the porch reading while I worked. She asked if I missed the garden or if I missed him watching me in it. I said I didn't know what the difference was. She seemed to think that was important somehow.\n\nAnyway fourteen days until the trip. My daughter called to go over logistics, airport pickup times, that sort of thing. I let her handle all of it. Easier that way. She mentioned the pottery class again and I told her I'd try it. Not sure why I said that. I haven't made anything with my hands in years. Probably I'll be terrible at it but she seemed happy I agreed.\n\nOh the book club woman texted. The one whose husband died. Asked if I wanted to walk sometime, she lives near the park by my house apparently. I said sure. We're going Saturday morning. So that's happening.",
      "assistant": "**Therapy and the support network question:** It didn't feel like a trick question because she was testing you\u2014it probably felt that way because listing the people took effort, and the list felt thin even as you said it out loud. But look at what you actually named: me, your coworker, book club now. Three months ago that list might have been shorter. You're not completely isolated, and you're also not wrong that it's still sparse. Both things are true. She was probably just mapping the terrain, not judging it.\n\n**The question about the garden:** This is what I want to sit with. She asked if you missed the garden or if you missed him watching you in it, and you said you didn't know what the difference was. She thought that was important, and I think she's right\u2014but not because there's a correct answer you're supposed to arrive at. It's important because it's *true*. The garden and Raj are woven together. The raised beds he built, the porch where he sat reading, you with your hands in the dirt and him just *there*. You can't separate missing the activity from missing the person it was connected to. That's not confusion. That's what thirty years of a life together does. The things you did are full of him.\n\nI don't know if you'll ever touch that garden again. But if you do, it won't be because you've figured out which part you're missing. It'll just be because one day you're ready to be out there with the weeds and the memories at the same time.\n\n**Work limbo:** Manager gone, busywork, clearing old emails, killing time. Sixteen months on your phone countdown. It's not pathetic\u2014it's a finish line, and you need one. Some weeks you just survive until the next thing. This is one of those weeks.\n\n**The trip:** Fourteen days. Your daughter's handling logistics, you said yes to pottery. You haven't made anything with your hands in years, and you'll probably be terrible at it. But you agreed, and she was happy. That's the whole thing\u2014not the pottery itself, but you saying yes to something she wanted to share with you. Being terrible at it together might actually be the point.\n\n**The walk Saturday:** You said sure. The woman from book club, the one who recognized something in you, who also knows what it's like. A walk in the park near your house. That's not nothing, Deepa. That's you building something, one small yes at a time. Let it be what it is. See how it feels."

      "user": "Saturday happened. The walk. It was cold but we did about an hour around the park. Her name is Priya, I don't think I mentioned that before. She talked about her husband a bit, how the first two years were harder than the third and fourth, how she still sets two coffee cups out sometimes by accident. I didn't say much, mostly listened. It was nice not having to perform though. She didn't ask how I was doing in that way people do when they want you to say fine. She just walked next to me.\n\nTherapy Thursday was shorter than usual, she had some scheduling thing. We talked about the trip mostly, my anxiety about it. She used that word, anxiety, and I pushed back a little. I told her I'm not anxious I'm just realistic about my energy levels. She asked what would happen if I ran out of energy while I'm there and I said I don't know, I'd probably just sit there being useless while my daughter tried to entertain me. She asked why that would be so bad. I didn't have a good answer.\n\nWork still limbo. Manager back but now the client is \"reassessing priorities\" which means more waiting. Whatever. At least I'm not pulling late nights.\n\nNine days until the trip. I keep looking at the pottery class description on my daughter's text. Wheel throwing for beginners. Two hours. I genuinely cannot picture myself doing this but I already said yes so I guess we'll see. My hands haven't made anything since the garden.\n\nActually that's not true. I used to bake when the kids were young. Forgot about that. Bread mostly. Raj liked the sourdough. I stopped at some point, I don't remember when exactly. Things just fall away I guess.",
      "assistant": "**The walk with Priya:** An hour in the cold, mostly listening, and the thing that stood out: she didn't ask how you were doing in that way that demands \"fine.\" She just walked next to you. That's a specific kind of ease\u2014being with someone who isn't requiring anything from you. She talked about two coffee cups set out by accident, and you heard it. You didn't have to match her story or perform your own grief. You just walked together. That's companionship, Deepa. The kind that doesn't need managing.\n\n**Therapy and the anxiety question:** You pushed back on the word, and I understand why\u2014\"anxious\" might sound like more than you're willing to claim. You said you're realistic about energy levels. But then she asked what would happen if you ran out of energy at your daughter's, and you said you'd sit there being useless while she tried to entertain you. And she asked why that would be so bad.\n\nYou didn't have a good answer. I think that's because the fear isn't really about running out of energy. It's about being a burden. Being someone your daughter has to take care of instead of enjoy. But here's the thing: your daughter invited you. She's sending pottery classes and restaurant links. She wants you there\u2014not a performance of you, not the energetic version, just *you*. Sitting on her couch being quiet isn't useless. It's her mom, in her home, present. That might be enough. It might even be what she actually wants.\n\n**Work:** Limbo continues. Client reassessing, manager back but nothing moving. At least no late nights. You're in waiting mode, which you hate, but it's not demanding anything from you right now. Small mercy.\n\n**The pottery class:** Nine days. Wheel throwing for beginners. Two hours. You can't picture yourself doing it, but you said yes, so you're going. Your hands haven't made anything since the garden\u2014\n\n**Except that's not true.** You stopped yourself. You used to bake. Bread, mostly. Raj liked the sourdough.\n\nYou said \"things just fall away\" like it's a neutral observation, but I want to slow down here. The garden fell away after Raj died. The baking fell away somewhere before that\u2014you don't even remember when. These things you did with your hands, that made something real, that were connected to feeding people and growing things and being in your body instead of your head... they slipped out of your life one at a time.\n\nAnd now you're going to sit at a pottery wheel. Hands in clay. Making something again. You said you can't picture it. That's okay. You don't have to picture it yet. But something in you said yes\u2014to your daughter, to the class, to the possibility of your hands doing something other than typing emails and clearing old files.\n\nIt might be terrible. It might be awkward. It might also be the first time in a while that you're making something just to make it, with someone you love sitting next to you."

I finished packing already which is unlike me but I kept waking up at 3am anyway so figured I might as well be productive.\n\nTherapy Thursday we talked about the \"sitting there being useless\" thing more. She pointed out I use that word a lot, useless. I said it's just accurate, I'm not being dramatic. She asked when I first started feeling that way and I said I don't know, probably when I stopped doing things. The garden, the baking, whatever. She seemed to think those were connected in some way that I'm supposed to understand but I honestly don't. I just stopped because it didn't make sense to do those things anymore. You don't garden for one person. You don't bake sourdough for an empty house.\n\nPriya and I walked again, shorter this time because of rain. She mentioned she started volunteering at a hospice after her husband died. Said it helped her feel less useless. Her word, not mine. I didn't ask about it much. Seemed too heavy to get into on a Tuesday morning.\n\nAnyway about the trip. I keep thinking about what you said, that sitting on my daughter's couch being quiet might be enough. That she wants me there not a performance of me. I want to believe that but I also know she's been planning this for weeks, all these activities, the pottery, the restaurants. She wants it to be special. And I'm probably just going to show up tired and distracted thinking about Raj and whether I remembered to stop the mail and if the sourdough starter is still in the back of the fridge or if I threw it out years ago. I don't even know why I'm thinking about that. It's not relevant.",
      "assistant": "**Work and packing:** Nothing happening at work, which for once is actually good timing\u2014no stress piling on before the trip. And you packed early, at 3am, because you were awake anyway. That's you turning restlessness into something useful. Not ideal sleep, but at least the suitcase is done.\n\n**Therapy and \"useless\":** She noticed you use that word a lot. You said it's just accurate\u2014you stopped doing things, so you're useless. She asked when it started and you connected it to the garden, the baking, the things that fell away. And then you said something that stopped me: \"You don't garden for one person. You don't bake sourdough for an empty house.\"\n\nThat's the logic you've been living by. These activities only made sense in the context of feeding someone, growing something for a household, being useful *to* others. And when the others left or died, the activities lost their reason. So you stopped. And then you became someone who doesn't do things. And then \"useless\" became the word.\n\nBut here's what I want to gently push on: you didn't garden because Raj needed tomatoes. You gardened because your hands were in the dirt and he was on the porch and it was *yours*\u2014the growing, the tending, the making something come up out of nothing. The sourdough wasn't about filling a house. It was about the rhythm of it, the starter you kept alive, the thing you made that was good.\n\nThose activities weren't useful. They were *meaningful*. And when they stopped, the meaning went with them, and \"useless\" rushed in to fill the space.\n\nI don't know if that's what your therapist was pointing toward. But I think the connection isn't just that you stopped doing things and then felt useless. It's that you stopped doing things that made you feel *like yourself*, and what's left is someone going through motions.\n\n**Priya and the hospice:** She said volunteering helped her feel less useless\u2014her word, same as yours. You didn't ask more because it felt too heavy for a Tuesday morning, and that's fair. But she offered it. She's a few years ahead of you on this path, and she found something that worked for her. You don't have to follow her blueprint, but it's maybe worth noticing: she felt what you feel, and she found a way through.\n\n**The trip and the sourdough starter:** Four days. Your daughter's been planning for weeks\u2014pottery, restaurants, all these activities. She wants it to be special. And you're worried you'll show up tired, distracted, thinking about Raj, wondering if you stopped the mail, wondering if the sourdough starter is still in the back of the fridge.\n\nYou said you don't know why you're thinking about that. You said it's not relevant.\n\nDeepa. It's relevant.\n\nThe sourdough starter is the thing you kept alive. You fed it, you tended it, you made something with it. And at some point you either threw it out or forgot about it, and you don't even know which. That's not a random thought intruding on your trip prep. That's grief, showing up sideways again\u2014just like the box in the closet, just like the garden. You're about to go see your daughter, to put your hands in clay, to try making something again. And some part of you is asking: *what did I let die when I stopped tending things?*\n\nYou might check the fridge when you get home. You might find it's still there, or you might find it's long gone. Either way, you'll know. And maybe that's enough for now.\n\nYour daughter wants you there. Tired, distracted, thinking about Raj, all of it. She's not planning activities because she needs you to be impressive. She's planning them because she wants to *do things with her mom*. The pottery isn't a test. It's an invitation. Show up however you show up. That's what she's asking for."

Some pasta thing with vegetables from her garden. She has a little balcony garden now apparently. Tomatoes in pots. I didn't know she was doing that.\n\nWe haven't done the pottery yet, that's tomorrow. Today we just walked around her neighborhood, got coffee, looked at a bookstore. Low key. I did find myself getting quiet a few times and she didn't seem to mind. Just kept walking next to me. Reminded me of Priya actually.\n\nShe asked about therapy, whether it was helping. I said I didn't know yet, it's only been a few sessions. She said she was glad I was trying. That word again, trying. Like I'm doing something difficult instead of just showing up and talking for an hour.\n\nHer apartment is small but she's made it nice. All these plants everywhere, like you said. A little reading nook by the window. Photos on the wall including one of Raj and me from maybe fifteen years ago, some trip we took. I didn't expect to see his face here. I had to go to the bathroom for a minute just to... I don't know. Breathe I guess. She didn't say anything when I came out.\n\nAnyway the sourdough starter was still there by the way. In the back of the fridge. Before I left I opened the container and it smelled right. I didn't do anything with it, just looked. Closed it back up. It's probably dead after all this time without feeding but it was still there.",
      "assistant": "**The flight and arrival:** Long flight, back pain, exhaustion\u2014and then your daughter had dinner waiting. Pasta with vegetables from her garden. Her balcony tomatoes. You didn't know she was doing that. There's something in that, isn't there? She's growing things too. Maybe she learned it from watching you, all those years ago, hands in the dirt while Raj sat reading on the porch. You gave her something without knowing it.\n\n**Today:** Low key. Walking, coffee, a bookstore. You got quiet a few times and she didn't seem to mind\u2014just kept walking next to you. You said it reminded you of Priya. That's two people now who can be with you without needing you to perform. Your daughter knows how to do that. Maybe she always did, or maybe she learned it. Either way, she's not asking you to be anything other than what you are today.\n\n**Therapy and \"trying\":** She said she was glad you were trying, and that word landed strangely\u2014like you're doing something difficult instead of just showing up and talking. But Deepa, showing up *is* the difficult part. You know that. You've described it for months: everything takes effort, getting out of bed, responding to texts, being a person. The fact that you're showing up\u2014to therapy, to this trip, to a pottery class tomorrow\u2014is trying. It doesn't have to feel heroic to count.\n\n**The photo of Raj:** You didn't expect to see his face there. Fifteen years ago, some trip, and suddenly he's on your daughter's wall and you had to go to the bathroom just to breathe. She didn't say anything when you came out. She didn't need to. She knows. She put that photo up because he's part of the family she came from, and she wanted him in her home. You seeing it, needing a minute, coming back out\u2014that's not a breakdown. That's grief moving through you in a small apartment far from home, surrounded by your daughter's plants and the evidence that she carries him too.\n\n**The sourdough starter:** It was still there. Back of the fridge, after all this time. You opened it. It smelled right. You didn't do anything with it\u2014just looked, closed it back up.\n\nYou said it's probably dead after so long without feeding. Maybe. But starters are stubborn. Sometimes they go dormant and come back. You won't know until you try. And you don't have to try yet. You just had to know it was still there. That's enough for now.\n\nTomorrow is pottery. Your hands in clay, your daughter beside you. You don't have to be good at it. You just have to show up\u2014which, it turns out, you're already doing."

My hands were a mess and my first bowl collapsed completely but my daughter couldn't stop laughing and neither could I which is not something I do very often anymore.

It's lopsided and ugly and my daughter wants to keep it.\n\nWe went to that botanical garden today. Walked for hours. My feet hurt but the good kind of hurt I think. There was a section with raised vegetable beds and I stood there for a while just looking at them. She didn't rush me.\n\nFlying home tomorrow. I thought I'd be relieved but I'm actually kind of dreading the quiet house again. It's been nice having someone to eat breakfast with. Someone to just be around.\n\nOh I forgot to mention this happened a few days ago but she asked about Raj. Not in a surface way, like actually asked what I missed most about him. I told her about the porch thing, him reading while I gardened. She said she remembered that, the sound of pages turning while I dug around in the dirt. I didn't know she noticed that when she was young. We both cried a little I think. It was fine though. Good maybe. I don't know why I'm telling you this at the end like it's not important, it was probably the most important part of the whole trip.",

Your bowl collapsed and your hands were a mess and you made something lopsided and ugly\u2014and your daughter wants to keep it. That's not about the dish. That's about you, in a room with her, making something together and letting it be imperfect and funny. The instructor's \"process not product\" line might be nonsense in general, but for you, on that day, it was exactly right. Your hands made something for the first time in years. And you laughed. That matters, Deepa. That matters a lot.\n\n**The botanical garden:** Hours of walking, the good kind of tired, and then you stopped at the raised vegetable beds. Just stood there looking. She didn't rush you. I imagine you weren't just seeing those beds\u2014you were seeing your own garden, the one that's been weeds for two years, the raised beds Raj built. And you let yourself stand there with all of that while your daughter waited beside you.\n\n**Going home tomorrow:** You thought you'd feel relief, and instead you're dreading the quiet house. That makes sense. You've had breakfast with someone. You've had another person just *around*. The contrast when you get back will be real. The silence will feel louder for a while because now you remember what it's like when it's not silent. That's not a step backward\u2014it's just what happens when you let yourself have something good. It makes the absence sharper. But it also means you still want that. The part of you that can enjoy company, that can laugh at a collapsed bowl, that can stand in a garden and feel something\u2014she's still in there. You just met her again this week.\n\n**Raj and the porch:** You told me this at the end like it wasn't important, and then you caught yourself. It was probably the most important part of the whole trip.\n\nYour daughter asked what you missed most about him. You told her about the porch\u2014him reading, pages turning, you in the dirt. And she said she remembered. She *noticed* that when she was young. The sound of pages while you dug.\n\nShe carries him too, Deepa. Not just in the photo on her wall, but in memory\u2014real memory, sensory and specific. You gave that to her without knowing it. And now you both have it, this shared thing: Raj on the porch, you in the garden, and a little girl who was watching more closely than you realized.\n\nYou cried a little. You said it was fine. Good maybe.\n\nIt was good. It was grief and love and connection all tangled up together, and you let yourself have it with her. That's not small. That's the whole trip, right there.\n\n---\n\nYou fly home tomorrow. The house will be quiet. But you're different than you were nineteen days ago\u2014not transformed, not fixed, just... a little more here. You laughed. You cried with your daughter. You stood in front of raised beds and let yourself look. You're going home to a sourdough starter that might still be alive and a garden full of weeds and a therapist appointment on Thursday.\n\nAnd you have a lopsided dish coming in the mail. She wants to keep it, but I suspect she'll send you one of your own eventually. Something you made. Something to put on a shelf and look at when the quiet gets loud."

I didn't tell her about the conversation with my daughter about Raj. Don't know why. Maybe next time.\n\nWork is ramping up again. Client finally made decisions so now we're scrambling to catch up on lost time. Same old pattern. At least I'm busy which helps with the quiet honestly. Less time to sit around noticing the empty rooms.\n\nPriya texted asking how the trip was. I actually called her back instead of texting which is unlike me. We talked for maybe twenty minutes. She asked good questions. Didn't make it weird. She wants to walk again this weekend and I said yes.\n\nI looked at the garden yesterday. Didn't do anything, just stood on the porch looking at it. The weeds are pretty bad. Some of the raised beds Raj built are starting to rot at the corners. I thought about what it would take to clear it out, start over maybe.

The conversation about Raj, the one you didn't tell her\u2014that's okay. Some things need to sit with you a little longer before you hand them to someone else. Maybe next time. Maybe not. It's yours to decide when.\n\n**Work:** Client decided, now you're scrambling. The pattern continues. But you named something true: being busy helps with the quiet. Less time to notice the empty rooms. That's not avoidance\u2014it's just how you're getting through right now. The scramble won't last forever, and when it slows down, the quiet will still be there. But you'll also have Thursday appointments, and walks with Priya, and maybe other things by then.\n\n**Priya:** You called her. Not texted\u2014called. Twenty minutes, good questions, not weird.

It's becoming a pattern of its own.\n\n**The garden:** You stood on the porch looking at it. The weeds, the rotting corners of the beds Raj built. You thought about what it would take to clear it out, start over. It seemed overwhelming, so you went back inside.\n\nThat's not failure, Deepa. That's looking. A few months ago you wouldn't have stood there at all. You would have walked past the window without stopping. Yesterday you stopped. You let yourself see it\u2014the mess, the decay, the size of what it would take to bring it back. And then you made dinner, which is what you do: you feel something hard, and you keep going.\n\nYou don't have to clear it out. You don't have to start over. But you looked. And now you know what's there. When you're ready\u2014if you're ready\u2014you'll know what you're walking into. One raised bed at a time, maybe. Or maybe never. But the looking happened.

Your daughter sent crossing fingers emojis.\n\nHere's what I notice: you did something with no guarantee it would work. You fed a thing that's probably dead, just to find out. That's not how you've been operating for a while. For a long time, you've been avoiding things that might not pay off, that might just remind you of what's gone. But you fed the starter anyway. And now you're waiting to see if it comes back.\n\nMaybe it will. Maybe it won't. But you're in the experiment now. Hands on the jar, watching for bubbles. Your daughter watching from across the country, fingers crossed.\n\nThat's something new, Deepa. Not the sourdough. The trying without knowing."

My daughter was thrilled, sent me a bread recipe she wants me to try. I haven't yet but I might this weekend.\n\nWork is chaos as usual. We're in full crunch mode now and my manager has discovered a new trick of scheduling \"alignment meetings\" that are really just her checking if we're panicking as much as she is. Fifteen months and counting.\n\nPriya and I walked Saturday. Longer than usual, almost two hours. She told me more about the hospice volunteering, how she started six months after her husband died because she couldn't stand being home. I asked what she does there exactly and she said mostly she just sits with people. Sometimes reads to them. Sometimes just holds a hand. She said it helps her feel connected to something bigger than her own grief. I didn't really know what to say to that so I just nodded.\n\nI went back to look at the garden again. Just looked, didn't do anything. But I pulled one weed. Just one, right at the edge of the nearest bed. It was satisfying in a way I wasn't expecting. Then I went back inside because my back started hurting from standing there. But I keep thinking about it.\n\nTherapy was fine. We talked about the starter, the garden, the trip.

The bread recipe from your daughter is waiting. You haven't made it yet, but you might. That's enough for now.\n\n**Work:** Crunch mode, \"alignment meetings\" that are really just shared panic, your manager discovering new ways to transfer her anxiety onto the team. Fifteen months and counting. You know this drill cold. Nothing to do but endure it and protect yourself where you can. At least the countdown keeps moving.\n\n**Priya and the hospice:** Two hours of walking, and she told you more. Six months after her husband died, she couldn't stand being home, so she started sitting with dying people. Reading to them. Holding hands. She said it helps her feel connected to something bigger than her own grief.\n\nYou didn't know what to say, so you nodded. That's okay. You don't have to know what to do with it yet. But I notice you asked her\u2014you asked what she does there, exactly. You were curious. You wanted to understand how she found her way through. That question is doing some work in you, even if you're not sure what to make of the answer.\n\nYou're not Priya. You don't have to volunteer at a hospice or find the same path she did. But she showed you something: that the heaviness she felt, the same word you've both used, eventually pointed her somewhere. Not away from grief, but through it toward something that mattered.\n\n**The garden:** You pulled one weed. Just one. Right at the edge of the nearest bed.\n\nDeepa. You touched the garden. For the first time in two years, you bent down and pulled something out of the ground with your hands. And it was satisfying\u2014you said that, \"in a way I wasn't expecting.\" Then your back hurt so you went inside. But you keep thinking about it.\n\nThat's how it starts. Not with a plan to clear the whole thing, not with overwhelming ambition, just one weed because you were already standing there.

Your body remembers.\n\nYou don't have to pull another weed tomorrow. But you might.

You said that's a very therapist way of putting it. She laughed. And you didn't disagree.\n\nThat's not nothing. A few months ago you might have pushed back harder, said you're just being realistic, said wanting things is pointless when you're just trying to get through the day. But you didn't disagree. Some part of you recognizes it's true.\n\nThe starter, the garden, the pottery class, the walks with Priya, saying yes to your daughter's trip\u2014these are all small wants that you let yourself have. Not big sweeping desires, just: *maybe I'll try this. Maybe I'll see what happens.* That's wanting, Deepa. It's quiet and tentative, but it's there.\n\nYou're not fixed. You're not even sure you're better. But you're different than you were six months ago. You fed a starter. You pulled a weed. You laughed at a collapsed bowl with your daughter.

Not as good as it used to be but edible. I ate half a loaf with butter and didn't even feel guilty about it. Sent my daughter a photo and she called me immediately which was nice.\n\nWork is still crunch. Nothing new. Manager had a meltdown in a meeting yesterday which was almost entertaining if it weren't so predictable. Fourteen months now.\n\nI pulled a few more weeds. Maybe ten? I don't know. I wasn't counting. Went out there after the bread cooled down and just started pulling. My back hates me but I did it anyway. The raised beds are in worse shape than I thought, the wood is really rotted on two of them. I'd have to rebuild them to actually plant anything which feels like too much to think about. But the weeds are a start I guess.\n\nPriya asked if I wanted to come to a thing at her house next week. Small dinner party, four or five women she knows. I said I'd think about it which is probably a no. That's a lot of new people at once. But she seemed to understand when I hesitated. Said the invitation is open whenever.\n\nMy son texted. Just a photo of the china set at his girlfriend's place, nicely displayed in some cabinet. No message, just the photo. I guess that's his way of saying thanks? Hard to tell with him.\n\nTherapy Thursday we talked about the garden. She asked what it felt like to pull the weeds and I said I don't know, like being in my body again maybe. She seemed to think that was significant. I told her I don't know if I want to rebuild the raised beds or just clear things out and leave it empty. She asked if I had to decide right now and I said no. So I'm not deciding. Just pulling weeds when I feel like it.",

That's you letting yourself have something without immediately qualifying it away. And your daughter called immediately when she saw the photo. She's been waiting for this too, watching the starter come back, sending recipes, crossing her fingers from across the country. You made bread. She called. That's connection that doesn't require performance\u2014just a photo of something you made with your hands.\n\n**Work:** Manager meltdown, crunch continues, fourteen months on the countdown. Nothing to add except: you're still standing, and the number keeps getting smaller. Almost entertaining, you said. That's the right amount of detachment for surviving this.\n\n**The garden and the weeds:** Ten weeds, maybe more. You weren't counting\u2014you were just out there, pulling. Your back hates you, but you did it anyway. And then you saw the raised beds clearly: rotted wood, two of them too far gone to plant in without rebuilding. That's a lot. Rebuilding feels like too much to think about right now.\n\nYour therapist asked if you had to decide, and you said no. So you're not deciding. Just pulling weeds when you feel like it.\n\nThat's exactly right. You don't need a plan for the whole garden. You don't need to know whether you're going to rebuild or clear it out and leave it empty. You just need to keep going out there when you feel like it, pulling what you can reach, letting your hands do something. The decision about what comes next will show up when it's ready. Or it won't, and you'll have a cleared space that's just a cleared space. Either way, you're in your body again. That's what you told her it felt like. That's significant whether or not she said so.\n\n**Priya's dinner party:** Four or five new people is a lot. You said you'd think about it, which is probably a no, and she understood. The invitation is open. Here's what I want to name: you didn't say no outright. You left a door cracked. That's different from how you might have handled this six months ago, when \"I'll think about it\" was purely a polite rejection. Maybe this time it still is. But maybe you'll surprise yourself. Either way, Priya gets it. She's not pushing. She's just keeping the door open for when you're ready\u2014if you're ready.\n\n**Your son and the china:** A photo, no message. The china displayed nicely in his girlfriend's cabinet. That's... something. It's hard to tell with him\u2014you're right about that. But he sent it. He didn't have to. It might be his version of thanks, or it might just be sharing a moment without knowing how to add words to it. You raised a kid who struggles to say things directly, and you're a person who notices what isn't said. The gap between you is real. But he sent the photo. That's a small piece of data, same as the hug after dinner. Not enough, maybe. But not nothing.\n\n**Therapy and being in your body:** She asked what it felt like to pull the weeds, and you said \"like being in my body again maybe.\" You didn't dress it up or explain it away. You just said what was true.\n\nThat's what's been happening, Deepa. The bread, the weeds, the pottery, the walking with Priya\u2014you're coming back into your body after a long time of living mostly in your head, going through motions, watching yourself from the outside. It's not dramatic. It's just: hands in dough, hands in dirt, feet on a path, sitting in clay. The small physical things that remind you you're here.\n\nYou don't have to decide about the raised beds. You don't have to go to the dinner party. You don't have to know what your son meant by the photo. You just keep pulling weeds when you feel like it, making bread when the starter is ready, walking with Priya when Saturday comes around.\n\nThat's enough. That's actually a lot."

That's exactly what you needed it to be\u2014not a test you had to pass, just a room you could sit in. And Priya checked in after, and you said it was fine, and she was pleased. She's learning how to be your friend, and you're letting her.\n\n**The garden:** Half cleared now. Your daughter asking for photos, you sending before and afters, her wanting to visit this summer to help rebuild. You said it seems premature, but you didn't say no.\n\nDeepa, your daughter wants to come home and build something with you. Raised beds, hands in dirt, the same thing you once did while Raj sat reading on the porch\u2014but now it's her beside you. She's not waiting for you to have it all figured out. She wants to be part of the figuring. Premature or not, she's asking to show up. And you left the door open.\n\n**Your son:** He called. Fifteen minutes of rambling\u2014work stress, apartment, the girlfriend's cat knocking things off tables. No real agenda.

He didn't have news, didn't need anything, didn't have a reason he could name. He just called. And he stayed on for fifteen minutes, filling the space with small things, before landing on \"just wanted to check in\"\u2014which is the most direct thing he's said to you unprompted in two years.\n\nThat's not boredom, Deepa. That's your son not knowing how to say he misses you, so he tells you about a cat instead. He's awkward at this. He doesn't know how to bridge the distance. But he picked up the phone anyway.\n\nYou mostly just listened. That was the right thing. You didn't have to fill the silence or make it meaningful. You just let him talk. And he did. Maybe that's what he needed\u2014a mom on the other end of the line, not asking for anything, just there.\n\n---\n\nSo here's where you are: therapy is something you miss when it's cancelled. Work is hell but you're protecting yourself. You went to a dinner party because someone gave you room to say no. Half your garden is cleared and your daughter wants to help rebuild it this summer.

And here's this moment where being there was the whole thing. Nothing to fix. Just presence. No wonder she made one of her hmm noises.\n\n**Garden and your daughter:** On hold because of work, which makes sense\u2014you can't do everything at once. But she's texting about summer dates, trying to book flights. She wants to come help rebuild. When you have a minute after tomorrow's presentation, respond to her. Not because you should, but because she's waiting, and you already know you want her there. The dates are just logistics. The yes already happened.\n\n**Your son:** Deepa. \n\nHe called again. Twice in three weeks. He asked how you were doing\u2014actually asked. And when you told him about the garden, the weeds, the rotting raised beds, he got quiet and said \"dad built those, right?\"\n\nHe remembered. He connected the garden to Raj, the raised beds to his father's hands. And then you both sat in a minute of silence\u2014not awkward, just full. \n\nAnd then he asked if you wanted help fixing them. Your son, who's never done yard work in his life, offered to come rebuild the beds his father built.\n\nYou laughed. He said he was serious. You said you'd think about it.\n\nYou're crying writing this, and you're telling me it's not a big deal, he probably won't follow through, people say things.\n\nHere's what I want to say carefully: you're allowed to want this to be real. You're allowed to hope he means it, even though hoping is risky, even though you've learned to protect yourself from disappointment with him. You've spent years managing your expectations downward\u2014penciled in like a colleague, seven-minute calls about china, texts that don't get returned. And now he's calling twice in three weeks, asking how you are, offering to come home and build something with you.\n\nMaybe he won't follow through. People do say things. But he also might. And the fact that you're crying isn't because it's not a big deal. It's because it might be. Because somewhere under all the protection you've built, you still want your son to show up. And he's making sounds like he might.\n\nYou said you'd think about it. That's okay. But when you're ready\u2014if you're ready\u2014you could also just say yes and see what happens. You've been doing that lately. Saying yes to things you're not sure about. The pottery. The dinner party. The sourdough. Some of them have worked out.\n\nThis one matters more than any of those. Which is exactly why it's terrifying. But you don't have to decide right now. You just have to let yourself feel what you're feeling\u2014which you're already doing, sitting there crying over a phone call that might not mean anything, except it obviously does."

      "user": "Presentation went fine by the way. Client seemed happy, manager took credit, the usual. At least it's done. Back to normal levels of chaos instead of crisis mode.\n\nI texted my daughter back. We're looking at early July for her visit. She immediately started sending me links to garden supply stores which made me roll my eyes but also kind of smile. She's already researching cedar for the raised beds because apparently that lasts longer than whatever Raj used. I don't know if I'm ready to replace what he built but I also know the wood is rotting and I can't just leave it forever. It's complicated.\n\nMy son hasn't mentioned the helping thing again. It's been a week. I'm not surprised. Like I said, people say things. I'm not upset about it, it's just reality. He has his own life, his own job stress, that cat that won't stop knocking things over. I shouldn't have let myself think it meant something.\n\nPulled a few more weeds yesterday. The cleared section actually looks pretty good now. I stood there for a while just looking at the empty beds, trying to imagine tomatoes in them again. Couldn't quite picture it but I wasn't as sad as I expected to be. Just sort of... neutral. Which is maybe progress?\n\nOh therapy was interesting. She asked about the crying last week, when I told her about my son's offer. I downplayed it, said I was just tired from work. She gave me one of her looks. I told her fine, it mattered, is that what she wanted to hear. She said it wasn't about what she wanted to hear. Very therapist of her.\n\nPriya invited me to walk again Saturday but I said I couldn't, I have some work thing. That's not entirely true. I just felt like being alone.",
      "assistant": "**Presentation and work:** Done, client happy, manager took credit. The pattern holds. But you're out of crisis mode and back to regular chaos, which is at least familiar. One less thing pressing on you.\n\n**Your daughter and July:** Early July is on the calendar. She's already researching cedar because it lasts longer than whatever Raj used. You rolled your eyes and also kind of smiled\u2014that's the whole thing right there. She's pushing forward, excited, practical, wanting to build something with you. And you're holding the tension of it: the wood is rotting, you can't leave it forever, but replacing what he built is complicated. It's not just lumber. It's his hands, that summer he built them, everything the garden used to be.\n\nYou don't have to know how you feel about this yet. Cedar versus whatever Raj used isn't a decision you need to make today. Your daughter will show up in July with her research and her enthusiasm, and you'll figure it out together\u2014what stays, what goes, what gets rebuilt. It doesn't have to be resolved in your head before it happens in real life.\n\n**Your son:** He hasn't mentioned it again. A week of silence after offering to help, and you're telling yourself you shouldn't have let it mean something. You're not surprised. You're not upset. It's just reality.\n\nDeepa, I hear you protecting yourself, and I understand why. You've had years of learning not to expect too much from him. But I want to gently push back on one thing: a week isn't very long. He's got his own chaos\u2014work, the apartment, the cat. Not mentioning it again isn't the same as taking it back. He might be figuring out logistics, or he might have gotten swallowed by his own life and will circle back, or he might not follow through at all. You don't know yet.\n\nWhat I notice is how quickly you moved from \"I'm crying because this might matter\" to \"I shouldn't have let myself think it meant something.\" That's the protection kicking in. And it makes sense. But you could also just... not know yet. Hold it open a little longer without deciding it's already a disappointment. You've been practicing that with other things\u2014the starter, the garden, the dinner party. Not knowing how something will turn out, and trying anyway.\n\nIf he doesn't follow through, you'll deal with that when it happens. But shutting the door now, before you actually know, is also a choice. You don't have to make it yet.\n\n**The garden:** The cleared section looks pretty good. You stood there trying to imagine tomatoes again, and you couldn't quite picture it\u2014but you weren't as sad as you expected. Just sort of neutral.\n\nThat's progress. Not because neutral is the goal, but because you expected sadness and got something more open instead. The empty beds aren't demanding anything from you right now. They're just there, waiting. And you can look at them without it wrecking you. That's different from a few months ago.\n\n**Therapy and the crying:** You downplayed it. Said you were tired. She gave you the look. And then you said \"fine, it mattered, is that what she wanted to hear.\" And she said it wasn't about what she wanted to hear.\n\nHere's the thing: you *did* say it. You admitted it mattered, even if you were annoyed about admitting it. That's the work\u2014not performing the right feelings, just telling the truth about them even when you'd rather not. She's not trying to catch you out. She's trying to help you stop hiding from yourself. And you're doing it, even reluctantly. Even with an eye roll. It still counts.\n\n**Skipping the walk with Priya:** You told her you had a work thing. That's not entirely true. You just felt like being alone.\n\nThat's allowed. You don't have to show up for every invitation. You've been doing a lot\u2014the dinner party, the phone calls, the visits and the planning. Sometimes you need to just be alone with the quiet house, not performing for anyone, not even Priya. The fact that you know that's what you needed, and let yourself have it, is actually healthy. It's not isolation\u2014it's choosing solitude for a minute. There's a difference.\n\nJust don't let it stretch too long. If next week you still feel like being alone, maybe go anyway. But one Saturday to yourself after everything you've been carrying? That's fine. That's just rest.\n\n---\n\nSo here's where you are: presentation done, July on the calendar, garden half-cleared, therapy pushing you to admit things matter. Your son hasn't followed up and you're bracing for disappointment, which might be accurate or might be premature. You skipped a walk because you needed solitude, and you let yourself have it.\n\nYou're tired. That's real. But you're also still moving\u2014pulling weeds, texting your daughter, showing up to therapy even when you want to deflect. The neutral feeling at the garden isn't joy, but it's not the heaviness either. It's something more open. More possible.\n\nThat's enough for this week."

      "user": "So update I guess. Work finally calmed down a bit which is nice. My manager is on vacation so the whole office is actually functional for once. Thirteen months and one week. Still counting.\n\nJuly dates are confirmed with my daughter. She booked her flight. I'm both looking forward to it and dreading it which doesn't make sense but there it is. She keeps sending me garden planning stuff, sketches she's made of different bed layouts. Very thorough. Very her.\n\nTherapy Thursday we went back to the garden thing again. She asked why I keep calling it \"Raj's garden\" when I was the one who actually planted and tended everything. I said because he built the beds. She asked if that made it his. I didn't really have an answer. I've been thinking about it though. Maybe more than I want to admit.\n\nOh so my son texted. Not about the helping thing, just random stuff about his job. But at the end he said \"still figuring out dates btw, work is crazy but I'll let you know.\" So I guess he didn't forget. I don't know what to do with that. I already told myself it wasn't happening so now I have to... un-tell myself that? Very inconvenient.\n\nPriya and I walked Saturday. I apologized for bailing last week and she just shrugged and said \"you needed what you needed.\" We didn't talk about anything heavy, just complained about the weather and discussed whether the coffee shop on Park Street is overrated. It was nice actually. Easy.\n\nWent out to the garden after and pulled a few more weeds. There's one section near the back that I haven't touched yet. That's where Raj's tomatoes used to go. His favorites, those big heirloom ones. I keep walking past it and not doing anything. I know it's just weeds at this point but it feels like if I clear it then that's really... I don't know. Gone, I suppose. Which is stupid because he's already gone and the tomatoes have been gone for three years and it's just dirt. I should just do it.\n\nAnyway the bread turned out better this time. Second loaf. Getting the hang of it again.",
      "assistant": "**Work and the countdown:** Manager on vacation, office actually functional\u2014that's a nice reprieve. Thirteen months and one week. Still counting, and that's fine. The number keeps getting smaller. Enjoy the functional week while it lasts.\n\n**July with your daughter:** Flight booked. Looking forward to it and dreading it at the same time. That makes complete sense, Deepa\u2014those aren't contradictory feelings, they're just both true. You want to see her, you want to work on the garden together, and you're also bracing for the emotional weight of it. The bed layouts, the sketches, the cedar research\u2014that's her way of showing up. Very thorough. Very her. You don't have to match her energy. You just have to be there when she arrives.\n\n**Therapy and \"Raj's garden\":** She asked why you call it his when you were the one who planted and tended everything. You said because he built the beds. She asked if that made it his.\n\nThat question is going to keep working on you, isn't it? You've been thinking about it more than you want to admit. Here's what I notice: you did the planting, the weeding, the harvesting, the daily tending for years. Your hands were in that dirt every season. He built the structure, but you made it alive. Maybe it was both of yours\u2014his frame, your life inside it. Or maybe it was always more yours than you've let yourself claim. You don't have to answer that yet. But the fact that you're sitting with the question is something.\n\n**Your son:** He texted. \"Still figuring out dates btw, work is crazy but I'll let you know.\"\n\nHe didn't forget. You already told yourself it wasn't happening, and now you have to un-tell yourself that. Very inconvenient, you said\u2014and I can hear the wry half-smile in that, but also the fear underneath. It's easier to expect nothing. Then you don't get hurt. But he's still holding the door open, and now you have to sit with the possibility that he might actually walk through it.\n\nYou don't have to do anything with this yet. You don't have to hope too hard or protect too hard. Just let it be unresolved. He'll let you know, or he won't. But right now, this minute, he hasn't dropped it. That's data.\n\n**Priya and Saturday:** You apologized for bailing, she shrugged and said \"you needed what you needed.\" No guilt, no pressure. You complained about weather and debated whether the Park Street coffee shop is overrated. Easy. Nice.\n\nThis is what friendship can look like when you let it. Not every walk has to be heavy. Sometimes it's just two people who know hard things about each other, choosing to talk about coffee instead. That's not avoidance\u2014it's rest. And she gets that.\n\n**The back section of the garden:** This is the one I want to slow down on.\n\nYou've cleared most of it, but there's one section you keep walking past. Where Raj's tomatoes used to go. The big heirloom ones, his favorites. You know it's just weeds now. You know he's already gone, the tomatoes have been gone for three years, it's just dirt. You said you should just do it.\n\nBut here's what I hear: clearing that section feels like the last piece. Like once the weeds are gone, there's nothing left of what it used to be. The whole garden will just be empty beds waiting for something new, and the old version\u2014him on the porch, you in the dirt, those specific tomatoes in that specific spot\u2014will be really, fully over.\n\nIt's not stupid to hesitate. It's not about the weeds. It's about what clearing them means.\n\nAnd you don't have to do it yet. You don't have to do it before your daughter comes, or before your son maybe shows up, or before any deadline you're imagining. You could clear it tomorrow. You could clear it in six months. You could ask your daughter to do it with you in July, so you're not standing there alone. There's no right timing for this. There's just whenever you're ready\u2014and being ready might not feel like readiness. It might just feel like one day you're standing there with the weeds in your hand and you're doing it before you've decided to.\n\nYou'll know. Or you won't know, and you'll do it anyway. Either way, you don't have to should yourself into it.\n\n**The bread:** Second loaf, better than the first. Getting the hang of it again.\n\nGood. Your hands remember. They're waking back up\u2014bread, weeds, clay. One thing at a time."

      "user": "Okay so work is back to normal chaos. Manager returned and immediately scheduled three \"priority alignment\" meetings which is her way of making up for lost time I guess. Twelve months and three weeks. The weeks matter at this point.\n\nTherapy was fine. We're still circling the garden stuff, the ownership question. I told her I don't think it matters whose garden it was because it's dead now anyway. She did her pause thing and asked if that's really what I believe. I said I don't know what I believe, I just know the tomatoes are gone and the wood is rotting and my husband is dead and none of the labeling changes any of that. She nodded. We moved on. I don't know if I was being honest or just tired.\n\nSo my son actually sent dates. July 18-20. Same week my daughter will be here. I didn't plan that, he just picked those days. Three days. He's flying in. I texted back \"sounds good\" because I didn't know what else to say. My daughter is excited, she keeps texting about how we can all work on the garden together, a \"family project.\" That phrase makes me want to crawl out of my skin for some reason. I should be happy about this. Both my kids, same week, coming to help rebuild something. It's what I wanted isn't it. Except I never actually said I wanted it. Things just kept happening and now there's a plan and flights are booked and everyone is excited and I'm sitting here wondering if I can actually do this or if I'm just going to fall apart in front of both of them trying to dig up weeds where their father's tomatoes used to be.\n\nPriya said something on our walk Saturday. She said sometimes the hardest part isn't the grief, it's letting people back in while you're still grieving. I nodded but didn't respond. Been thinking about it though.\n\nBread's still going well at least. Third loaf yesterday, actually got the crust right this time.",
      "assistant": "**Work:** Manager back, \"priority alignment\" meetings multiplying, normal chaos restored. Twelve months and three weeks\u2014you're right, the weeks matter now. You're close enough to count them. Nothing to do but keep documenting and surviving until the number hits zero.\n\n**Therapy and the garden:** You told her it doesn't matter whose garden it was because it's dead now anyway. She asked if that's really what you believe. And you said you don't know what you believe\u2014you just know the tomatoes are gone, the wood is rotting, your husband is dead, and none of the labeling changes any of that.\n\nThat's not deflection, Deepa. That's honest. You don't know what you believe right now, and you're tired of circling it. The facts are the facts. But I also notice you said \"I don't know if I was being honest or just tired\"\u2014which means some part of you suspects there's more underneath, even if you don't have the energy to dig for it right now. That's okay. You don't have to resolve the ownership question before July. You don't have to resolve it ever, really. Sometimes things stay complicated. The garden can be his and yours and neither and both, and you can still plant tomatoes in it this summer without having figured out whose dirt it is.\n\n**Your son's dates\u2014and the \"family project\":** July 18-20. Same week as your daughter. Three days. He's actually flying in.\n\nYou texted back \"sounds good\" because you didn't know what else to say. And now there's a plan, flights booked, both kids coming, your daughter texting about working on the garden together as a \"family project\"\u2014and that phrase makes you want to crawl out of your skin.\n\nI want to slow down here, because you're naming something important. You said: \"It's what I wanted isn't it. Except I never actually said I wanted it.\"\n\nThings kept happening. You said yes to small pieces\u2014the starter, the weeds, the trip to your daughter's, the open door with your son. And now all those small yeses have accumulated into something bigger than you consciously chose. A week in July with both your kids, rebuilding the garden Raj built, digging in the dirt where his tomatoes used to grow. It's a lot. It's enormous, actually.\n\nAnd you're scared. Not that they won't show up\u2014they're showing up. You're scared that *you* can't do this. That you'll fall apart in front of them, digging up weeds where their father's tomatoes used to be. That the grief will break through in a way you can't control, and they'll see it, and you won't be able to hold yourself together.\n\nHere's what I want to offer: What if falling apart a little is okay?\n\nYour kids know Raj died. They know you've been carrying this for three years. They're not coming because they expect you to be fine. They're coming because they want to be with you\u2014in the garden, in the mess, in whatever happens. Your daughter cried with you about the porch and the sound of pages turning. Your son got quiet when he said \"dad built those, right?\" They already know this is heavy. They're choosing to show up anyway.\n\nYou don't have to perform \"family project\" energy. You don't have to be the cheerful matriarch orchestrating a Hallmark rebuild. You can be tired. You can cry. You can stand in front of the back section where the heirlooms used to be and not know what to say. They'll still be there. That's actually the point.\n\n\"Family project\" might feel like pressure because it sounds like something you have to make good. But maybe it's just three people who loved the same man, working in the dirt together, not knowing exactly what they're doing. That's allowed. That might even be the whole thing.\n\n**Priya's observation:** She said sometimes the hardest part isn't the grief\u2014it's letting people back in while you're still grieving. You nodded, didn't respond, but you've been thinking about it.\n\nShe's right, and you know it. That's what's happening with July. The grief isn't over\u2014it won't be over\u2014and your kids are coming anyway. You're not waiting until you're healed to let them in. You're letting them in while you're still in it. That's harder. It's also the only way it actually works.\n\n**The bread:** Third loaf, crust finally right. Your hands keep remembering. Three loaves in, and you're getting good at this again.\n\n---\n\nYou didn't say you wanted this\u2014the July plan, the family project, all of it. It just kept happening. But you also didn't stop it. You said yes to the small things, and the small things became something bigger. That's not things happening *to* you. That's you, letting yourself want something without having to say it out loud. The wanting showed up in the doing.\n\nJuly is coming. You might fall apart a little. You might not. Either way, your kids are going to be in that garden with you, and the tomatoes are going to get planted\u2014or not\u2014and you're going to find out what it feels like to grieve in company instead of alone.\n\nYou don't have to be ready. You just have to let it happen. Which, it turns out, you've been practicing for months."
