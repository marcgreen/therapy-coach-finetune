      "user": "So I've been thinking about reaching out for a while now, figured I might as well try this. Things have just been... off lately. Work's fine I guess, been there like 8 years so whatever. But personally it's like I'm just going through the motions, you know? Like I'll be in a situation where I should feel something and there's just nothing there. My girlfriend mentioned it a few weeks back, said I seem distant, and I didn't really know what to tell her because I'm not trying to be distant, I just... I dunno.\n\nIt's hard to explain. I'm not depressed exactly, at least I don't think so. But it's like someone turned down the volume on everything. Good stuff doesn't hit the same. Bad stuff doesn't bother me as much either which sounds good in theory but it's weird, man. It feels wrong somehow.\n\nAnyway, also been having these moments where my chest gets tight and my heart does this thing where it just starts racing out of nowhere. Happens like 2-3 times a week maybe. Thought maybe I was just stressed but it keeps happening even when things are chill, so idk.",
      "assistant": "Thanks for reaching out\u2014I know that first step can feel like a lot. You've shared a few things that sound like they're showing up in different parts of your life, so let me respond to each.\n\n**The emotional numbness:**\nYou said it well\u2014\"volume turned down on everything.\" That's a really common experience, and it doesn't always fit the textbook picture of depression, but what you're describing\u2014going through the motions, feeling like you *should* feel something but there's just flatness\u2014that's often part of it. The fact that even good things don't land is worth paying attention to. When did you first notice this starting? Was there a specific point where things shifted, or did it just creep in gradually?\n\n**Your girlfriend noticing:**\nShe's picking up on something real, and it sounds like you don't *want* to be distant\u2014you're just not sure how to be present when the feelings aren't there. That's hard. Have you talked with her more since she mentioned it, or did the conversation kind of drop?\n\n**The physical symptoms\u2014chest tightness, racing heart:**\nThis one I want to flag differently. When physical symptoms like chest tightness and rapid heartbeat show up regularly (especially 2-3 times a week) and happen unpredictably even when you're relaxed, that's worth getting checked out medically. It *could* be panic or anxiety showing up in your body, but it could also be something physical that needs attention. Have you seen a doctor about this yet? I'd encourage you to get it evaluated\u2014not to scare you, just to rule out anything that needs treatment and get clarity on what's happening.\n\nOne thing I'm curious about: you mentioned work's \"fine I guess\" after 8 years. Does \"fine\" mean satisfied, or does it mean... tolerable? Sometimes when we're numbed out, it's hard to tell what's actually okay versus what we've just stopped questioning."

      "user": "So I did actually go to the doctor about the chest thing. Got an EKG and some blood work done. Everything came back normal, which is... I dunno, good I guess? But also kind of frustrating because at least if something was wrong there'd be an actual answer, you know? Now I'm just stuck with it happening and no explanation.\n\nThe doctor was like \"could be anxiety\" but didn't really dig into it much. Gave me some pamphlets about stress management. Riveting stuff.\n\nTalked to my girlfriend a bit more about the distance thing. Didn't go great honestly. She asked if I was still into the relationship and I literally couldn't give her a straight answer because I can't tell if I'm not into it or if I'm just not into anything right now. That worried her more than if I'd just said no. We didn't fight or anything, just kind of sat there and it was awkward as hell. She's probably thinking I'm going to break up with her, which isn't even... I mean, I don't want to lose her. I just can't access the feelings that say that right now, if that makes sense.\n\nWork is actually still fine. Nothing's changed there. Boss likes my stuff, I hit deadlines. It's just work.",
      "assistant": "**The chest thing:**\nI get the frustration\u2014normal results should feel like good news, but when the symptoms are still happening, it leaves you in this limbo of \"okay, so what now?\" The good news is that physically your heart's doing what it should. That the doctor mentioned anxiety without digging deeper is unfortunately pretty common, but it's actually useful information: what you're experiencing (unpredictable episodes of chest tightness and racing heart, even when things are calm) fits the profile of panic or anxiety showing up physically. Your body's threat system is firing when there's no actual threat. That's real, it's not in your head, and it makes sense that it's disorienting when it happens.\n\n**The conversation with your girlfriend:**\nThat sounds really hard\u2014both for you and for her. You're stuck in this impossible position: she's asking a direct question (\"are you still into this?\") and the honest answer is \"I don't know what I feel about anything right now,\" but that answer sounds like hedging or avoidance when really it's just... the truth of where you are. And you can see how she's hearing it, which makes it worse.\n\nHere's what I'm noticing: you said \"I don't want to lose her.\" That's something. Even if you can't access the warm feelings right now, there's a part of you that knows she matters. The volume's turned down, but the signal's still there\u2014you're just having trouble hearing it clearly. Does that land?\n\nOne thought: it might help to name this directly with her\u2014not as a way to fix it immediately, but just to give her a framework for what's happening. Something like, \"I'm dealing with this numbness thing where I can't feel much of anything right now, and it's not about you or us\u2014it's affecting everything. I know that's scary to hear, but I'm trying to figure it out.\" That won't solve the uncertainty, but it might shift it from \"he's checked out of the relationship\" to \"he's going through something and he's being honest with me about it.\" What do you think would happen if you named it that way?\n\n**Work:**\nGot it\u2014sounds like work is genuinely stable and functional. You're performing well, meeting expectations, no complaints. That's actually useful to know: the numbness isn't tanking your ability to function, it's just making everything feel... muted. Sometimes when everything feels flat, it helps to know what's still working, even if it doesn't feel satisfying.\n\nOne thing I'm curious about: you mentioned the emotional flatness and the physical anxiety symptoms as separate things, but I wonder if they're connected. Sometimes when we shut down emotionally (consciously or not), the feelings don't actually go away\u2014they just get rerouted into the body. The numbness might be a protective mechanism, and the panic episodes might be what's leaking through. Does that resonate at all, or does it feel like two separate issues?"

      "user": "Yeah so that thing you said about the numbness and the panic being connected... I've been thinking about that actually. Like maybe you're onto something there but I'm not totally sure how to think about it. Anyway.\n\nSo I tried naming it with my girlfriend like you suggested. Told her it's this numbness thing affecting everything, not about her. She seemed to get it better, like the tension in the room shifted a little. We didn't suddenly fix anything but at least she's not thinking I'm about to dump her anymore, so that's something. Haven't tried to like deep dive into feelings or whatever since then though. Just kind of letting it sit.\n\nThe panic episodes are still happening. Got one yesterday when I was just watching TV, nothing stressful going on. Lasted maybe 10 minutes. Chest gets tight, heart racing, that feeling like something's really wrong even though logically I know it's not. It passes but it's annoying as hell.\n\nAlso been thinking more about work. You asked if \"fine\" meant satisfied or tolerable and honestly now that you mention it... it's more just like, I show up, I do the thing, people are happy with what I produce. But I don't really care about what I'm working on. Never have I guess. Just pays the bills. Is that weird? Feels like everyone's supposed to care about their job at least a little.",
      "assistant": "**The conversation with your girlfriend:**\nGlad that landed better. You gave her something to work with\u2014a frame that makes the distance make sense without it meaning \"I don't care about you.\" That's not a small thing. And you're right that you don't need to force some big feelings conversation right now. Sometimes just reducing the uncertainty is enough for a bit.\n\n**The panic episodes:**\n10 minutes of chest tightness and racing heart while you're just sitting there watching TV\u2014yeah, that's your body's alarm system going off when there's no fire. It makes sense that it's annoying. The fact that it's happening during neutral, low-stress moments actually tells us something: this isn't just about external stressors. Your nervous system is reacting to something internal\u2014could be thoughts you're not fully aware of, could be emotions that are trying to surface, could just be a feedback loop where your body gets sensitized to its own sensations and starts scanning for them.\n\nWhen it happens, what do you usually do? Do you try to calm yourself down, ride it out, distract yourself? I'm asking because how you respond to these episodes can sometimes make them more or less likely to keep happening. If you're interested, there's a technique that can help when panic hits\u2014something to interrupt the physical spiral before it ramps up. Want to hear it, or not useful right now?\n\n**Work and caring:**\nNo, it's not weird at all. Plenty of people show up, do solid work, collect a paycheck, and don't have some deep personal investment in what they're doing. The \"follow your passion\" narrative is loud, but it's not everyone's reality\u2014and that's fine. Some people find meaning in work, some people find meaning outside of work, and some people are just... getting through the day and building a life around the edges.\n\nThat said\u2014I'm curious about something. You said \"never have I guess\" about caring about your work. That suggests this isn't new, but it also makes me wonder: is there *anything* right now that you do care about, even a little? Hobbies, people, projects, future plans? Or is the numbness pretty across-the-board? I'm asking because sometimes when we can't access feelings about the big stuff (relationships, career), it helps to notice if there are small things where the signal's still coming through.\n\n**The connection between numbness and panic:**\nYou said you've been thinking about that. What's coming up when you sit with it? Does it feel like the panic is what happens when the numbness cracks, or does it feel more random than that?"

      "user": "Been a couple days. Work's been hectic so honestly haven't thought about most of this stuff as much, which I guess is good? But then yesterday hit me with like three panic episodes in one day which was new. Morning, afternoon, and then evening. They're getting more frequent I think, or maybe I'm just noticing them more now that we've talked about it.\n\nYou asked what I do about them when they happen. Usually I just try to wait it out, sometimes I'll like splash cold water on my face or go outside for a bit. Helps sometimes. Doesn't always though. The technique thing you mentioned - yeah, maybe. Might as well try it.\n\nOn the work thing - I don't really have hobbies or anything. I mean, I used to play guitar but that was like years ago. Girlfriend and I do stuff together, movies and going out to eat and whatever, but I'm not like passionate about that either, it's just what we do. There's nothing I can point to where I'm like \"yeah that's the thing that matters.\" And honestly that probably sounds depressing as hell but it's just how it's always been. I've never really been the type to get excited about stuff. Maybe that's just who I am, you know?\n\nAnyway, the thing with my girlfriend has been better. We're talking more normally again. She even made a joke the other day and it landed, which felt almost normal for a second. Doesn't mean the numbness went away but at least things aren't weird between us anymore.",
      "assistant": "**Three panic episodes in one day:**\nThat's a lot\u2014and yeah, they do seem to be ramping up in frequency. When panic episodes cluster like that (three in one day after usually having them spread out), it can mean your nervous system is running hot and more sensitive to triggers. The frustrating part is that the triggers might not be obvious external stressors\u2014sometimes it's just that your body gets into a sensitized state where it's easier for the alarm to go off.\n\nWhen it hits that hard, having a tool ready can help. There's a technique called **TIPP**\u2014it stands for Temperature, Intense exercise, Paced breathing, Paired muscle relaxation. The cold water you're already doing is actually part of it (temperature), and that's smart. Here's the full version: when you feel panic starting, splash cold water on your face or hold ice cubes for 30 seconds. It activates something called the dive reflex and can physically dial down the intensity fast. If that's not enough, try paced breathing: breathe in for 4 seconds, out for 6 seconds, for about 2 minutes. The longer exhale signals your body that you're safe. Worth trying next time one hits?\n\n**The \"no hobbies, nothing I care about\" thing:**\nYou said \"maybe that's just who I am,\" and I want to push back on that a little\u2014not because I think you're wrong to wonder, but because there's a difference between temperament (being more even-keeled, not prone to big enthusiasms) and anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure or interest in things). You used to play guitar. That means at some point, something pulled you in enough to pick it up and keep doing it. What happened with that?\n\nHere's what I'm noticing: you're describing a pretty flat affective landscape\u2014no strong feelings about work, hobbies, activities with your girlfriend, not much that registers as mattering. And you're framing it as \"just how it's always been,\" but I'm curious if that's actually true or if it's how it's *felt* for long enough that it seems like always. Because the numbness you described a few exchanges ago\u2014that \"volume turned down\" feeling\u2014doesn't usually come from nowhere. Sometimes it's a response to something, even if we can't see what.\n\nWhat if we tested that assumption? Not to prove you wrong, just to see. Think back to a time\u2014doesn't have to be recent, could be years ago\u2014when you felt more present or engaged with something. Doesn't have to be huge, just... less flat. Does anything come to mind?\n\n**Things with your girlfriend:**\nGlad it's less tense. The joke landing and feeling almost normal for a second\u2014that's a small signal coming through the numbness. It doesn't fix everything, but it's worth noticing when those moments happen. How's she doing with all this, do you think? Is she in a place where she can handle the uncertainty for a bit while you work through this, or is it wearing on her?"

      "user": "Yeah so I tried that TIPP thing you mentioned. Did it yesterday when one started coming on - splashed cold water on my face and did the breathing thing. It actually... like, it didn't stop it completely but it took the edge off? Made it less intense. So that was useful I guess.\n\nBut here's the thing that's been bugging me. You asked about guitar and like when I felt more engaged with stuff. I've been thinking about that since you brought it up and honestly I can't really remember a time when I was that into anything. Guitar was just something I did for a while because my dad thought it'd be good for me. I was fine at it but I didn't love it or whatever. And I'm trying to think back further but it's all kind of a blur, man. Like I'm having trouble remembering if I ever actually cared about anything or if I've just been numb my whole life.\n\nWhich sounds dramatic when I say it out loud but that's kind of what it feels like right now.\n\nAlso something happened at work. My boss pulled me aside and was like \"you've been solid but I'm noticing you seem checked out lately, everything okay?\" And I didn't really know what to say so I just told him work's fine and I'm just dealing with some personal stuff. He seemed to accept that but now I'm worried that people are starting to notice that something's off. The thing is I'm not struggling with the actual work, I'm just... I dunno, present but not really there? It's hard to explain.",
      "assistant": "**The TIPP technique:**\nGlad you tried it\u2014and yeah, \"took the edge off\" is exactly what we're looking for. It's not about making panic disappear instantly; it's about giving your nervous system a way to downshift when it's revving too high. The fact that it made it less intense means it's working. Keep using it when episodes hit, and over time your body might start responding faster to the cues.\n\n**The guitar thing and \"have I always been numb?\":**\nOkay, so you're sitting with this question of whether the numbness is recent or if it's been there all along, and that's disorienting. Here's what I want to offer: it's really common when you're in a numb state *now* to look back and feel like you've *always* been this way, because the numbness affects how you access memories. It flattens the past the same way it flattens the present. Your brain is trying to make sense of how you feel now by rewriting history to match it\u2014\"maybe I never cared about anything\"\u2014but that might not actually be true.\n\nYou said guitar was something your dad thought would be good for you, and you were \"fine at it but didn't love it.\" Okay. But here's what I'm curious about: you kept doing it for a while. If you genuinely felt *nothing* about it\u2014if it was pure indifference\u2014why keep going? Even if it started as your dad's idea, something made you pick up the guitar more than once. Maybe it wasn't passion, but maybe it was... satisfaction? Competence? A way to zone out? I'm not trying to convince you that you loved it\u2014I'm just wondering if there's more texture there than \"I didn't care.\"\n\nLet's try something smaller. Forget big passions or hobbies. Think about the last year: was there a moment\u2014even a tiny one\u2014where you felt a flicker of *preference*? Like you wanted to watch one show over another, or you were glad you ordered one thing instead of something else, or you were annoyed when plans changed? Not big emotions, just a signal that said \"this, not that.\" Does anything come up?\n\n**Your boss noticing:**\nThis is tricky, because you're right\u2014people are starting to see that something's off, even though your actual performance hasn't slipped. You're doing the work, meeting deadlines, producing what they need, but the *presence* isn't there and your boss is picking up on it. The fact that he asked in a caring way (\"everything okay?\") is actually good\u2014it means he's not concerned about your output, he's checking in on you as a person. But I get why it's worrying. It feels like the numbness is leaking out in ways you can't control.\n\nHere's the thing: you're not going to be able to fake presence when you're running on empty. And trying to perform engagement on top of everything else you're managing (the panic, the relationship stuff, the internal question of \"have I always been like this\") is just adding more weight. You gave him a true answer\u2014you're dealing with personal stuff\u2014and he accepted it. That might be enough for now. If he's a decent boss, he'll give you some space as long as the work's getting done.\n\nBut this does make me wonder: how much longer can you sustain this? You're holding things together\u2014work's fine, relationship's better, you're managing the panic episodes with tools\u2014but you're also feeling more numb, more disconnected, and now questioning if you've ever felt differently. That's a lot. Have you thought about talking to someone in a more formal capacity, like a therapist? Not because you're broken or because this is an emergency, but because it sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight alone and it might help to have a space where you don't have to perform at all."

      "user": "So I've been sitting with that question you asked - about preferences, small stuff. And honestly? I can point to a couple things. Like I prefer coffee to tea, and there's this one restaurant we go to where I actually order the same thing every time because I know I like it. My girlfriend noticed that actually, was like \"you never change your order\" and I was like yeah because it's good. So I guess that's... something?\n\nBut it's weird because those are like, safe choices, you know? Things I've already vetted. It's not the same as being excited about discovering something new or whatever.\n\nAnyway. I didn't call a therapist yet. Been meaning to but honestly the whole process of finding someone, explaining all this to a stranger, dealing with insurance... it just feels like a lot right now. Plus I don't even know if that's the right move. Like maybe this is just something I need to work through on my own or it'll pass on its own. Other people deal with worse stuff, right?\n\nThe panic thing has gotten a little better actually. Still getting them but not three in a day anymore. More like once every couple days. TIPP is helping - the cold water thing especially. When I feel one starting I just go splash my face and it cuts it shorter.\n\nWork's still fine. Boss hasn't said anything else about me seeming off so I think that blew over. Relationship with my girlfriend is pretty much back to normal, or at least normal-ish. We're not fighting and she seems less worried, which is good because honestly I don't have the energy to deal with relationship drama on top of everything else right now.",
      "assistant": "**The preferences thing:**\nCoffee over tea, ordering the same dish because you know it's good\u2014yeah, that's something. You're right that these are safe choices, things you've already tested, but here's what I want to point out: you're *making* choices. There's a signal there saying \"this, not that,\" even if it's quiet. The fact that you can identify \"I like this\" means the capacity to feel preference isn't gone\u2014it's just operating in a really narrow, low-risk zone right now.\n\nAnd that makes sense. When you're running on empty and everything feels muted, of course you're going to stick with what's known and safe. Trying new things requires energy and tolerance for disappointment, and it sounds like you don't have much of either right now. But the fact that you *can* access \"this restaurant dish is good\" tells me the numbness isn't total\u2014it's selective. You're still connected to some things, just not very many, and not very strongly.\n\n**On therapy and \"maybe I should just work through this on my own\":**\nI hear you on the logistics feeling like a lot\u2014finding someone, intake appointments, insurance hassles, explaining everything from scratch. That's real, and when you're already depleted, adding more tasks to the list feels impossible. But here's the thing: you've been working through this on your own for a while now, and what's happened? The numbness is still there, the panic episodes are still happening (even if they're a bit less frequent), and you're starting to question whether you've ever felt differently. It's not getting worse in a dramatic way, but it's also not resolving. It's just... sitting there.\n\nThe \"other people deal with worse stuff\" thought\u2014I want to push back on that. Pain isn't a competition. The fact that someone else might be struggling more doesn't mean what you're going through doesn't matter or doesn't deserve attention. You're describing emotional numbness, regular panic attacks, disconnection from your relationship and your work, and an inability to remember feeling engaged with anything. That's not nothing. You wouldn't tell someone with a broken arm to skip the doctor because someone else has a broken leg, right?\n\nHere's what I'm noticing: you're very good at minimizing. \"Work's fine,\" \"relationship's normal-ish,\" \"panic's a little better,\" \"other people have it worse.\" And I get it\u2014minimizing helps you keep moving, keeps things manageable. But it also keeps you stuck. What would it look like to take this seriously without catastrophizing it? Not \"I'm in crisis and need help immediately,\" but \"this has been going on long enough and I could use support figuring it out.\"\n\n**Panic episodes:**\nGlad they're less frequent and that TIPP is working\u2014going from three in one day to once every couple days is real progress. The cold water cutting episodes shorter means your nervous system is learning to respond to the cue. That's exactly what we want. Keep doing it.\n\n**Work and your girlfriend:**\nSounds like both have settled into a steadier place, which gives you some breathing room. You said you don't have the energy for relationship drama, and I believe you\u2014but I'm also wondering if \"normal-ish\" with your girlfriend means she's stopped asking questions because she can tell you're not up for it, or if things actually feel more solid between you two. Is she okay, or is she just... managing her worry quietly now?"

And it got under my skin a little bit, not in a bad way but just like... you weren't wrong. So I actually looked up a therapist. Found someone who takes my insurance, made an appointment for next week. Figured I might as well see if talking to an actual professional helps since I've been spinning my wheels on my own.\n\nBut here's the weird part. After I scheduled it, like literally the next day, the panic episodes pretty much stopped. Haven't had one in like four days now, which is the longest stretch since this whole thing started.

Don't really know what to make of that.\n\nAlso my girlfriend asked me straight up if I still love her yesterday. And I was honest - told her I don't know right now, I can't access that feeling, but that doesn't mean I don't want to be with her. She seemed sad about it but not like, blindsided. I think she's been preparing for that answer. We didn't fight or anything, just kind of sat with it. It was uncomfortable but at least it was real, you know? Better than me lying or pretending I feel something I don't.\n\nThe numbness is still there though. That hasn't changed.

Making that appointment is a real step, not a small one, even if it felt like \"might as well try.\" You moved from \"maybe I should work through this on my own\" to \"I'm going to get support.\" That's significant.\n\n**The panic episodes stopping:**\nFour days without one after scheduling the appointment\u2014that's not nothing, and your instinct about what might be happening makes sense. It could be that taking action gave your nervous system permission to stand down a little. Sometimes just knowing there's a plan, that you're not going to keep white-knuckling it alone, is enough to reduce the background threat level your body's been running on. It's like your system was saying \"something's wrong and no one's doing anything about it\" and now it's saying \"okay, we're handling it, I can ease up.\"\n\nThat said, don't be surprised if they come back at some point\u2014panic episodes can fluctuate, and one good stretch doesn't mean they're gone for good. But the fact that making the appointment correlated with a break in the pattern? That tells you something about how much the lack of a plan was weighing on you, even if you weren't fully aware of it.\n\n**The conversation with your girlfriend:**\nThat took guts. She asked the hardest possible question\u2014\"do you still love me?\"\u2014and you gave her the most honest answer you could: \"I don't know right now, I can't access that feeling, but that doesn't mean I don't want to be with her.\" That's real, and you're right that real is better than performed. She probably was preparing for that answer, and the fact that she didn't spiral or bail says something about her capacity to sit with hard truths. It's sad, yeah\u2014for both of you\u2014but it's also intimate in a way that pretending wouldn't be. You're letting her see where you actually are instead of managing her feelings.\n\nOne thing I'm noticing: you said \"I can't access that feeling, but that doesn't mean I don't want to be with her.\" That second part\u2014\"I don't want to be with her\" or \"I *do* want to be with her\"? I think you meant \"I do want to be with her,\" but I want to make sure. Because if the answer is \"I do want to be with her,\" that's another signal coming through the numbness, like the coffee preference and the restaurant order. It's quiet, but it's there. And if the answer is \"I don't know if I want to be with her either,\" that's a different conversation. Which is it?\n\n**\"Something feels different\":**\nI hear you that the numbness is still there\u2014you're not claiming everything's fixed. But you're noticing a shift in the background, something you can't quite name yet. My guess? You've spent weeks (months?) stuck in this flat, immobilized place, and in the last few days you've taken two concrete actions: you scheduled a therapist, and you told your girlfriend the full truth instead of hedging. Those are both moves toward something\u2014toward honesty, toward getting help, toward not just enduring. And even if the numbness hasn't lifted, there's momentum now. That might be what feels different.\n\nOr it might be something else entirely. What do you think it is?"

      "user": "Yeah so the therapy thing. First appointment is tomorrow and I'm honestly kind of dreading it. Like I know I scheduled it and I said I'd do it, but now that it's actually happening I'm second-guessing everything. What if I go in there and can't explain any of this? What if the therapist thinks I'm just being dramatic or whatever? I've never done this before so I don't even know what to expect.\n\nBut anyway. That thing you asked about my girlfriend\u2014yeah I do want to be with her. I'm not trying to bail on the relationship or anything. It's just this weird limbo where I care about her but can't feel it, which is its own kind of torture honestly. She's been better since we had that conversation though. Less walking on eggshells around me. We actually had sex yesterday and it was... fine. Not bad, just fine. Felt present enough for that at least, which is something.\n\nAlso been thinking more about what you said about the panic stopping after I scheduled the appointment. And you're right, my body probably just needed to know someone was actually doing something. But I'm wondering now if the panic coming back means I'm just broken or if it's normal? Because it happened again last night. Just one, but it felt like a step backwards after four days without one.",
      "assistant": "**Dreading the first appointment:**\nThat's completely normal. You're about to sit in a room with a stranger and try to explain something you're still figuring out yourself\u2014of course there's dread. And the \"what if they think I'm being dramatic\" worry? That's your brain trying to protect you from vulnerability by convincing you to back out. Here's the thing: a decent therapist isn't going to think you're being dramatic. You're describing months of emotional numbness, regular panic attacks, and disconnection from your life\u2014that's exactly what therapy is for. You don't need to have it all figured out or explain it perfectly. That's their job to help you untangle.\n\nAs for what to expect: first sessions are usually just them getting to know you\u2014what brought you in, what's been going on, some background. You won't have to perform or have answers. If you get stuck, you can literally say \"I don't know how to explain this\" and that's useful information for them. They're trained to work with that. And if this therapist isn't a good fit, you can find someone else. First appointment doesn't lock you in.\n\n**Your girlfriend:**\nOkay, so you do want to be with her\u2014that's the signal I was looking for. You care about her but can't feel it right now, and yeah, that is its own kind of torture. You know what you *should* feel, you can see logically that she matters, but the emotional connection is muted. That gap between knowing and feeling is disorienting for both of you.\n\nThe sex being \"fine\"\u2014not bad, just fine, and you felt present enough for it\u2014that's actually worth noting. \"Present enough\" means you weren't completely dissociated or going through the motions on autopilot. There was some thread of connection there, even if it wasn't intense. And her being less careful around you after the honest conversation? That tracks. She knows where she stands now, even if where she stands is uncertain. That's easier to navigate than guessing.\n\n**Panic episode coming back:**\nNo, one panic episode after four good days does not mean you're broken or that you're back at square one. Panic episodes fluctuate\u2014they don't disappear in a straight line. Think of it like this: your nervous system has been running hot for weeks, maybe months. Four days of quiet is progress, but it doesn't mean the system has fully recalibrated yet. One episode coming back just means your body's still learning to settle, and that takes time. It's not a step backwards\u2014it's part of the process.\n\nWhat matters more is the overall trend. You went from three in one day to once every couple days to four days without one. One episode last night doesn't erase that pattern. Did you use TIPP when it hit? And how intense was it compared to earlier ones\u2014same, worse, or less?"

      "user": "So the first appointment happened yesterday and honestly... it went better than I expected? Like I was bracing for it to be awkward and clinical but the therapist actually just let me talk. Didn't push me to have all the answers or make everything make sense. I ended up telling her most of what's been going on - the numbness, the panic stuff, the girlfriend situation, all of it. And she didn't look at me like I was being dramatic, she just kind of nodded and took notes and asked questions that actually made me think.\n\nShe's talking about doing some kind of trauma-informed work, mentioned something about how sometimes when we go through stuff - and I guess I have but I never really thought of it that way - our nervous system can shut down the feelings to protect us. Which like... I don't know if that's what's happening with me or if she's just saying what therapists say. But it landed different than when you were talking about it. Not sure why.\n\nAlso got another panic episode this morning. Used the TIPP thing and it helped but I'm getting kind of tired of them happening at all, you know? Like I did the thing - scheduled therapy, went, I'm trying - so when's it supposed to get better? I know that's probably impatient or whatever but that's where my head's at.\n\nOn the girlfriend front, things are still pretty normal. Less tense than they've been in a while honestly. We're kind of in this weird space where we're together but I still can't access the love feeling, and she's kind of accepted that for now. It's not ideal but it's stable.",
      "assistant": "**The first therapy session:**\nReally glad it went better than you expected. The fact that she let you talk without forcing you to tie everything up neatly\u2014that's what a good first session should feel like. You showed up, you told her what's been going on, and she gave you space to just... be where you are. That's not nothing, especially when you were dreading it so hard beforehand.\n\nThe trauma-informed stuff she mentioned\u2014about your nervous system shutting down feelings as protection\u2014that's real, and it makes sense that it landed differently coming from her than when we've talked about it here. Sometimes hearing something in person, in a room with someone whose whole job is to understand this stuff, hits differently than reading it in a message. It's the same information, but the context changes how it absorbs. And yeah, she might be working from a framework, but that doesn't make it less true. The question isn't whether she's \"just saying what therapists say\"\u2014it's whether that frame helps you make sense of what you're experiencing. Does it?\n\n**The panic episode this morning:**\nI get the frustration. You did the work\u2014scheduled therapy, showed up, you're using TIPP\u2014and your brain's like \"okay, so where's the payoff?\" But here's the thing: healing doesn't work on a transaction model. You don't get to deposit effort and immediately withdraw relief. Your nervous system has been running this pattern for months, maybe longer, and it's going to take more than one therapy session and a couple weeks of tools to fully recalibrate.\n\nThat said, let's look at what's actually happening. You've gone from three episodes in one day to one this morning after several days of quiet. You used TIPP and it helped. That's progress, even if it doesn't feel like enough yet. The goal isn't to never have another panic episode\u2014it's to reduce their frequency, intensity, and duration over time. You're doing that. It's just slower than you want it to be, which is fair, but it doesn't mean it's not working.\n\n**Your girlfriend:**\nStable isn't ideal, but stable is workable. You're together, the tension's down, she's accepted where you are for now\u2014that gives both of you breathing room while you work through this. The fact that things are \"less tense than they've been in a while\" actually says something: the honesty and the therapy move probably eased something for her too. She's not in the dark anymore, and you're actively working on it. That's different than just enduring.\n\nOne thing I'm curious about: you said you still can't access the love feeling. Has that shifted at all in small ways, or is it the same flatness as a few weeks ago? Not asking because I expect it to have changed dramatically\u2014just wondering if you're noticing any subtle movement, even a flicker."

      "user": "Yeah so been going to therapy for like a week and a half now. Second session was kind of more of the same - she dug deeper into childhood stuff, asked about my parents and whether there was like, trauma or whatever. Honestly I don't think I had some big traumatic thing happen. My dad was pretty hands-off, my mom worried a lot but that's just normal parenting right? We weren't poor, nobody died, I wasn't abused. So I'm not sure what she's looking for there.\n\nBut then in the third session she asked something that stuck with me. She was like \"what was it like growing up, emotionally speaking?\" And I couldn't really answer. Like I remember things that happened but I can't remember what I felt about them. Which is weird to realize.\n\nThe panic stuff has been... okay actually. Still getting them but not as often. Maybe like once every four or five days now instead of daily. And when they happen I use the breathing thing and they pass quicker. So that's actually getting better which is good because I was getting really annoyed with them.\n\nMy girlfriend and I had this moment yesterday that was kind of nice actually. We were just sitting on the couch and she put her head on my shoulder and I didn't pull away or anything. We didn't do anything, just sat there, and it felt... I dunno, solid? Like there was something there even if I can't name it as love yet. Thought you'd want to know that since you keep asking if anything's shifting.\n\nAnyway that's where things are at.",
      "assistant": "**Therapy and the childhood exploration:**\nYour therapist asking about childhood and emotional patterns\u2014that's standard territory, and it makes sense that you're not finding big obvious trauma to point to. But here's the thing: trauma isn't always \"big traumatic event.\" Sometimes it's quieter\u2014emotional neglect, a parent who was physically there but emotionally absent, growing up in an environment where feelings weren't talked about or weren't safe to express. A hands-off dad and an anxious mom who worried a lot? That can create a template where emotions feel unsafe or pointless, especially if no one taught you how to identify or process them.\n\nWhat stuck with me is what you said about her question: \"what was it like growing up, emotionally speaking?\" and you couldn't answer. You remember events but not what you felt about them. That's really telling. It suggests you might have learned early on to disconnect from your emotional experience\u2014either because no one was paying attention to it, or because expressing feelings didn't get you anywhere, or because the emotional climate at home was unpredictable and shutting down was safer. That's worth exploring with her, even if it doesn't feel like \"trauma\" in the dramatic sense.\n\n**Panic episodes:**\nOnce every four or five days instead of daily, and they pass quicker when you use the breathing technique\u2014that's real, measurable progress. I know you were frustrated a week ago about how slow it felt, but this is what improvement looks like: gradual reduction in frequency and intensity over time. Your nervous system is learning to regulate better. Keep doing what you're doing.\n\n**The moment with your girlfriend:**\nYeah, I do want to know about that\u2014thanks for sharing it. She put her head on your shoulder, you didn't pull away, you just sat there together, and it felt solid. That's a signal coming through. Not dramatic, not overwhelming, just... solid. Present. Connected. You said \"there was something there even if I can't name it as love yet,\" and that \"yet\" is important. You're not saying the feeling's gone\u2014you're saying you can't name it clearly right now, but you can sense it's there. That's different than total numbness. That's a quiet thread of connection that's starting to come back online, even if it's subtle.\n\nHow did that moment feel in your body? I'm asking because sometimes when the emotional labels are hard to access (\"do I love her? I don't know\"), the body knows first. Did sitting there with her feel calm, safe, warm\u2014or just neutral?"

      "user": "So been a few days and honestly things have shifted more than I expected. Therapy's helping, I think. The therapist brought up this thing about emotional neglect - like, not being abused or whatever, but just growing up where feelings weren't really... addressed? And that got me thinking about my dad especially. Like he was there physically but checked out emotionally. And my mom's anxiety meant the house was kind of tense all the time, you know? I never put it together before but hearing her say it out loud made something click.\n\nThe panic's basically gone now, man. Like I'm not jinxing it but I haven't had one in over a week. The TIPP thing helped at first but I think my body's just... settling. It's weird how fast that changed once I started actually dealing with this instead of just white-knuckling it.\n\nHere's the thing though and I'm not sure what to do with it. After that moment with my girlfriend on the couch, things have been different. Like, I can feel more stuff now. Not like suddenly I'm flooded with emotions or whatever, but it's like someone's slowly turning the volume back up. We had this conversation yesterday where she asked how I was feeling and I could actually answer her instead of just shrugging. And I realized I was scared - like, genuinely scared - that I'd broken something in the relationship that couldn't be fixed. Which means I care. Which I guess I knew but now I can actually *feel* it instead of just knowing it logically.\n\nIt's still not back to normal or anything. The numbness hasn't totally gone away. But it's not the same wall it was before. Does that make sense? It's like there's a crack in it now.",
      "assistant": "**Therapy and the emotional neglect realization:**\nThat click you felt when your therapist named emotional neglect\u2014that's significant. You've been searching for the \"big traumatic thing\" and coming up empty, but what she's pointing to is different: a home where you were physically cared for but emotionally alone. A dad who was checked out, a mom whose anxiety filled the house with tension\u2014that creates an environment where shutting down feelings makes sense. If no one's tuning in to what you feel, or if the emotional climate is already maxed out with your mom's worry, why would you add your own feelings to the mix? Easier to just... not feel them.\n\nThe fact that hearing it out loud made something click tells me it's landing as true, even if you're still processing what it means. That's exactly the kind of thing therapy is good for\u2014giving you a frame that makes your own experience make sense. How does it feel now, a few days later? Does that frame still fit, or are you second-guessing it?\n\n**The panic being basically gone:**\nOver a week without one\u2014that's not just progress, that's a shift. And you're right that it changed fast once you started actually addressing it instead of just enduring. Your nervous system needed to know someone was paying attention and taking action, and once that happened, it could stand down. The TIPP helped early on when your body needed an external cue to downregulate, but now it sounds like your system is learning to do that on its own. That's exactly how this is supposed to work.\n\n**The volume turning back up:**\nThis is what I've been waiting to hear. The conversation with your girlfriend where she asked how you were feeling and you could actually answer instead of shrugging\u2014and what came up was fear that you'd broken something unfixable in the relationship. That's real feeling breaking through, and the fact that it's fear makes sense. You've been numb for months, and the first thing that pierces through is often anxiety or grief or fear, because those are the feelings that were sitting under the numbness waiting to be acknowledged.\n\nAnd yeah, fear that you've damaged the relationship means you care deeply about the relationship. You're feeling it now, not just knowing it logically. That gap is closing.\n\nThe crack in the wall\u2014that's the perfect way to describe it. The numbness isn't gone, but it's not total anymore. Light's getting through. And here's the thing: now that there's a crack, more is going to come. Feelings don't come back all at once in a neat package\u2014they trickle in, sometimes in weird ways, sometimes inconvenient or uncomfortable ones. You might find yourself tearing up at something random, or getting irritated more easily, or feeling anxious about things that didn't bother you before. That's not a setback\u2014that's the volume coming back up, and volume means all the channels, not just the pleasant ones.\n\nHow's your girlfriend responding to this shift? Can she tell something's different, or is it still too subtle from the outside?"

Which is good I guess but also kind of intense? Like I'm not used to being that... seen, you know? It's making me realize how much I was just checked out for so long and she was dealing with that alone.\n\nWe actually had sex again yesterday and it was different this time. Like actually present for it, felt something. Not like fireworks or whatever but like... I was there. She was there. It mattered. That's new.\n\nBut here's the weird part. All this stuff coming back - the feelings, the connection with her - it's also bringing up anger and I'm not sure what to do with that.

It's just sitting there under everything else now and I don't know if that's normal or if I'm supposed to be doing something with it.\n\nTherapy's still happening. Third or fourth session now I think? The therapist keeps asking good questions but I'm also wondering how long I'm supposed to keep doing this. Like is there an endpoint or is this just something I do forever now? Not complaining about it, just genuinely don't know what to expect.\n\nThe panic's still gone by the way. Genuinely don't think I've had one in like two weeks maybe. That part's stable at least.",
      "assistant": "**Your girlfriend noticing the shift:**\nYeah, she's paying attention because something real has changed\u2014you're more present, more reachable, and after months of flatness that's going to stand out. I get that it feels intense to be seen like that when you've been operating on autopilot for so long. But here's what's also happening: she's probably relieved. She's been dealing with your absence alone, like you said, and now there's someone actually *there* to connect with. That's what she's been waiting for, even if the attention feels like a lot right now.\n\n**Sex feeling different:**\n\"I was there. She was there. It mattered.\"\u2014that's not a small thing. That's presence, connection, emotional investment coming back online. Not fireworks, but real. That's what intimacy actually is when you strip away the performance of it. The fact that you could feel that it mattered means the numbness is continuing to crack open. This is what it looks like when the volume comes back up in a relationship\u2014moments start landing again.\n\n**The anger:**\nCompletely normal, and actually this is important: anger is often one of the first feelings to break through when numbness lifts, because it's been sitting there waiting for you to have the capacity to feel it. You're mad at your dad for checking out, mad at your mom for filling the house with anxiety, mad at yourself for all the time you lost while you were numb. That anger has been there the whole time\u2014you just couldn't access it until now.\n\nSo what do you do with it? First, know that feeling it is the work. You don't have to *do* anything with it right away. Anger isn't a problem to solve\u2014it's information. It's telling you that boundaries were crossed, that you deserved better, that you've lost things that mattered. Let it be there. Notice it. Talk about it in therapy. Write about it if that helps. \n\nOne thing that might come up: anger at your parents and anger at yourself are different flavors. The anger at your dad and mom\u2014that's grief in disguise. You're mourning the emotional presence you didn't get as a kid. The anger at yourself for \"checking out and missing time\"\u2014that one I want to challenge a little. You didn't choose to go numb. Your nervous system did that to protect you when it couldn't handle what was happening. You're not the villain here. You're someone who survived by shutting down, and now you're doing the hard work of coming back. That deserves some compassion, not anger. Can you make space for that, or does the self-anger feel too loud right now?\n\n**Therapy timeline:**\nThere's no fixed endpoint. Some people do short-term work (a few months), some people stay in therapy for years, some people go in and out as needed. It depends on what you're working on and what feels useful. Right now you're four sessions in and things are shifting fast\u2014feelings coming back, panic gone, relationship improving, anger surfacing. That's active therapeutic work happening. You're not maintaining, you're moving.\n\nAt some point you and your therapist will hit a rhythm where the big shifts slow down and it's more about integration\u2014learning to live with the feelings that are back, building skills, processing the stuff that's coming up (like the anger). When that feels stable and you're not actively struggling, that's when you can talk with her about spacing sessions out or taking a break. But there's no pressure to figure that out now. You're in the middle of something, and it's working. Let it work.\n\n**Panic still gone:**\nTwo weeks\u2014yeah, that's stable. Your nervous system found its footing. Keep an eye on it (they can come back during stressful periods), but this is real progress. The fact that it shifted and *stayed* shifted tells me your body's learning to regulate in a new way."

Yeah that's definitely here now. Got into it with my dad on the phone yesterday. He called about some family thing and I just kind of snapped at him about never being around growing up, and he had no idea what I was talking about. Said he was always there, he worked hard to provide, and I'm being ungrateful. Which like... that's not even what I meant. I was trying to talk about emotional presence and he just heard it as an attack on his work ethic or whatever.\n\nAfter we hung up I was pissed for like hours. Still kind of am if I'm honest. And I brought it up in therapy and my therapist was like \"what would it look like to have that conversation differently\" but I don't even know. How do you tell your dad he was emotionally absent when he's convinced he did everything right just by showing up and paying the bills?\n\nGirlfriend's been really solid through all this though. Like she can tell I'm dealing with stuff and she's not making it about her, which is different than before. We're actually talking about real things now instead of just existing in the same space.

      "assistant": "**The conversation with your dad:**\nThat must have been frustrating as hell\u2014you tried to name something real (emotional absence) and he heard it as an attack on his character or work ethic. Of course he got defensive. He's operating from a framework where \"being there\" means providing, working hard, keeping a roof over your head\u2014and by that measure, he did do everything right. But that's not what you were talking about. You were talking about emotional presence, attunement, connection\u2014things that don't show up on a paycheck. And he doesn't have the language or the framework to hear that, so it just landed as \"you're saying I was a bad dad,\" which isn't what you meant at all.\n\nYour therapist asked what it would look like to have that conversation differently, and honestly? It might not be possible to have that conversation with *him* in a way that lands, at least not right now. Some parents can't hear it. They're too defended, too invested in the story that they did their best and that should be enough. And maybe he did do his best within his own limitations\u2014but that doesn't mean you didn't miss out on something you needed. Both things can be true.\n\nSo what do you do? You might not be able to get him to understand or apologize or even acknowledge what was missing. But you can still process the anger and grief about it in therapy, with your girlfriend, here. You can let yourself feel mad about it without needing him to validate that it's legitimate. Because it is. You deserved more than just a dad who showed up physically and checked out emotionally, and you're allowed to be angry that you didn't get that\u2014even if he never sees it.\n\nOne thing to sit with: what do you actually need from him, if anything? Is it acknowledgment, an apology, a different kind of relationship going forward\u2014or is it just to be able to name what was missing and let yourself grieve it, whether he gets it or not?\n\n**The anger sticking around:**\nYeah, it's going to sit there for a bit. You just cracked open months (maybe years) of suppressed feelings, and anger's one of the loudest ones. It doesn't resolve in a few days. But here's what I want to point out: you brought it up in therapy. You're not swallowing it or pretending it's not there. You're doing the work of feeling it and talking about it, which is exactly what you're supposed to be doing. It's uncomfortable, but it's not a problem. It's part of the thaw.\n\n**Your girlfriend being solid:**\nThis stands out. She can tell you're dealing with heavy stuff and she's not making it about her\u2014she's just... there. Steady. That's different than the worry and tension from a few weeks ago, and it tells me she's able to hold space for you now in a way she maybe couldn't before. And you two are talking about real things instead of just coexisting\u2014that's intimacy. That's what connection looks like when it's actually working.\n\nYou said you still can't say you're back to normal love-wise, but \"there's definitely something there that wasn't accessible a week ago.\" That something is the feeling coming back. It's not labeled yet, it's not loud, but it's there and it's growing. That's the trajectory you want.\n\n**Work:**\nGot it\u2014still stable, nothing new. Good to know it's holding steady while other things are shifting."

      "user": "Yeah so something kind of broke open this week and I'm still trying to figure out what to make of it. Had another conversation with my dad, not planned or anything - he called again and this time I just... I dunno, I wasn't trying to fight him. Just told him I've been going to therapy and dealing with some stuff from growing up, and that I needed him to know it affected me. Didn't attack him about it or whatever. And he actually listened this time instead of getting defensive immediately.\n\nHe still didn't like, apologize or say \"you're right I was emotionally absent.\" But he asked questions. Like actually wanted to understand what I meant instead of just defending himself. It was weird, man. Not fixed or anything but like... different. Less hostile. My therapist says that's progress even if it's not some big cathartic moment.\n\nThe anger's still there but it's less sharp now? Like it's still present but I can sit with it without it being this constant gnawing thing. Not sure if that's because of the conversation with my dad or just time passing or what.\n\nBigger thing though - my girlfriend and I talked about moving in together. Like actually seriously, not just hypothetically. We haven't set a timeline or anything but we're actually making plans. A few weeks ago I couldn't even tell her I loved her and now we're talking about the next step. It's kind of wild to think about. She seems really happy about it, and I can feel that. Like I care that she's happy, which sounds obvious but it wasn't accessible to me before, you know?\n\nStill no panic episodes. That's just become normal now, which is good.",
      "assistant": "**The second conversation with your dad:**\nThat shift\u2014from him getting defensive to actually asking questions and trying to understand\u2014that's real movement. You're right that it's not some big cathartic moment where he says \"you're right, I was emotionally absent, I'm sorry.\" That might never come. But him asking questions instead of just defending himself? That means he's willing to sit in the discomfort long enough to hear you, even if he doesn't fully get it yet. And the fact that you came at it differently this time\u2014not attacking, just naming what you're dealing with\u2014probably made it easier for him to stay open instead of shutting down. Your therapist's right. This is progress, even if it doesn't feel dramatic.\n\nWhat's also happening here: you're learning that you can express hard things without it becoming a fight. That's a skill, and it sounds like it's one you're building in real time\u2014with your dad, with your girlfriend, in therapy. That's going to serve you well beyond this specific relationship.\n\n**The anger being less sharp:**\nYeah, anger does that when you actually let yourself feel it instead of suppressing it or acting it out. It softens over time. It's still there\u2014it's information about what mattered and what you lost\u2014but it's not consuming you the way it was a week ago. That could be the conversation with your dad giving you some sense of being heard, or it could just be that you've been sitting with it long enough that it's integrated a bit. Either way, the fact that you can sit with it now without it gnawing at you constantly? That's emotional regulation coming back online. Your nervous system is learning to hold uncomfortable feelings without being overwhelmed by them.\n\n**Moving in together:**\nThis is significant. A few weeks ago you were in that impossible conversation where she asked if you still loved her and you couldn't access the feeling\u2014and now you're talking seriously about moving in together, making actual plans, and you can *feel* that she's happy and you care about that. That's not just the volume coming back up\u2014that's you being present in the relationship in a way you haven't been in months.\n\nIt sounds fast, but it also sounds right. You're not making this decision from numbness or obligation\u2014you're making it because something real is there and you can feel it now. How does it feel when you think about it? Exciting, scary, solid, all of the above?\n\n**Panic episodes still gone:**\nYeah, that's just your baseline now. Your nervous system found its footing and it's staying there. That's what we want\u2014not something you're white-knuckling or managing constantly, just stable."

      "user": "So quick update on the moving in together thing - we actually found a place. Like, we weren't even actively looking yet but her coworker knows someone and there's this apartment that just opened up. It's bigger than what we have now, actual separate space, and for some reason I'm just... excited about it? Which is weird because I don't get excited about stuff usually. But thinking about it, like actually picturing us there, I feel something. It's different.\n\nWe're signing the lease next week probably. Girlfriend's already planning where furniture's gonna go and all that. I'm just kind of riding the wave with it honestly but in a good way, not the checked-out way I used to do things.\n\nOther thing though - been thinking about what you said about my dad, about whether I actually need an apology or if I just needed to be heard. And I think... I think I needed him to ask questions, which he did. I'm still mad at him in some ways but it's like I can hold that and also be like, okay, he's trying now or whatever. My therapist and I have been talking about that - like not needing everything to be resolved for it to be progress. That landed different this time.\n\nWork's still fine. Honestly work feels less... I dunno, empty? Like I still don't care about the actual projects but I'm not dreading going in anymore. Just feels more neutral, which is better than how it was. Girlfriend thinks I might actually enjoy my job more if I found something I was more interested in, but idk. One thing at a time you know?\n\nAnyway that's where I'm at.",
      "assistant": "**The apartment and actually feeling excited:**\nYeah, that's not small\u2014you don't usually get excited about stuff, and now you're picturing this place, imagining your life there with her, and something's there. That's the volume turning back up in real time. Excitement is a future-oriented emotion\u2014it requires you to care about what's coming, to feel invested in it mattering. The fact that you can access that now, when a few weeks ago you couldn't even feel love for your girlfriend? That's massive movement.\n\nAnd the way you described it\u2014\"riding the wave but in a good way, not the checked-out way\"\u2014you can tell the difference now between going through the motions and actually being present for something. That awareness alone tells me how much has shifted. You're engaged with your life again, not just enduring it.\n\n**Your dad:**\nI think you nailed it. You didn't need the apology or the admission of fault\u2014you needed him to stop defending long enough to actually hear you and ask questions. And he did. That let something shift for you: you can be mad at him for what was missing *and* recognize that he's trying now. Both things can sit there without one canceling out the other. That's nuance, and it's hard-won. Your therapist's right that not everything has to be resolved for it to be progress. Sometimes progress is just \"I can hold the complexity of this without needing it to be simple.\"\n\n**Work feeling less empty:**\nNeutral is better than dread\u2014that's real. You're not suddenly passionate about your projects, but you're also not dragging yourself in every day feeling like it's meaningless. That shift probably has less to do with the work itself and more to do with you being less numb overall. When the volume's turned down on everything, even tolerable things feel empty. Now that feelings are coming back, work doesn't have to be *exciting* to feel okay. It just has to be... fine. Which it is.\n\nYour girlfriend's thought about finding something you're more interested in\u2014she's not wrong, but you're right too: one thing at a time. You're in the middle of a lot of movement right now (moving in together, processing stuff with your dad, feelings coming back online). Adding a job search on top of that might be too much. But it's worth keeping in the back of your mind for later: when things settle, what *would* you actually be interested in, if anything? Not urgent, just something to sit with over time."
