      "assistant": "**Work paranoia:** 15 years is a long tenure\u2014that history matters, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. The shift you're noticing (younger people getting projects) could be real, or it could be your mind filling in gaps when you're already feeling shaky. Either way, the fear is real. What would help you tell the difference between \"I'm seeing a pattern\" and \"I'm spiraling\"? One thing that might help: track it for a week. When you notice something that feeds the \"they're replacing me\" story, write down what actually happened versus what your mind says it means. Sometimes seeing it on paper makes the pattern clearer\u2014or shows you it's not as solid as it feels.\n\n**The chest thing:** Glad you made the appointment. That's the right move\u2014let your doctor rule out anything physical. It's been bugging you, you're getting it checked, that's good judgment."

      "assistant": "**Doctor appointment:** Next week works\u2014you did what you needed to do, even if the wait feels long. That's handled.\n\n**The restructuring meeting:** That sounds anxiety-provoking\u2014getting pulled into a vague meeting about \"restructuring\" with no details would make anyone's mind race. Here's what I'm noticing: your mind took \"sizing me up\" and turned it into \"they're cutting people.\" That's a leap. What did your manager actually say? Sometimes when we're already feeling vulnerable, ambiguity feels like evidence. It might be worth asking yourself: what are three other reasons they might restructure that have nothing to do with cutting you?\n\n**Jake getting the project:** That one stings, especially after you've been asking for months. I get why that felt like confirmation. But let me ask: have you actually pushed for it, or have you been hinting/waiting? You said \"probably my fault for not pushing harder\"\u2014that part might be true. If you've been indirect about what you want, they might not know how much it matters to you. Younger people sometimes get opportunities not because they're better, but because they ask louder. Worth thinking about: what would \"pushing harder\" have looked like? And is there still a way to name what you want directly, even now?\n\n**\"What's the point\":** That line worries me a little. When you say \"what's the point,\" what are you referring to\u2014pushing for projects? Staying at the job? Something bigger? That kind of hopelessness can make it hard to see options. Let's not close doors yet. You've been there 15 years\u2014that's not nothing. But if your mind is already writing the ending, it's going to be hard to show up in a way that changes the story. What would need to happen for you to feel like there's still a path forward here?"

      "user": "yeah so that \"what's the point\" thing\u2014i wasnt trying to be dramatic. just meant like why push for projects if theyre already decided. anyway.\n\ntalked to my mom yesterday and she said im being paranoid. she said \"thats just how corporations work, they restructure all the time, doesnt mean anything.\" which is fine i guess but also she doesnt work there so easy for her to say. then she asked if im eating ok and if ive been sleeping. honestly no on both counts. been up at like 3am most nights just thinking about it. stomach's been weird too.\n\ndoctor appointment got moved up actually. now its tuesday. i keep thinking about what they said about the chest thing\u2014like what if its not anxiety, what if somethings actually wrong. probably am overthinking it but hard not to.\n\nanyway the work restructuring thing should be finalized next week. theyre sending out details friday. im assuming ill find out then if im out or not.",
      "assistant": "**\"What's the point\":** Got it\u2014not dramatic, just realistic about feeling like the decision's already made. That makes sense. But here's the thing: if you act like it's already decided, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. You stop advocating for yourself, you pull back, and then they do see you as checked out. I'm not saying the restructuring is in your control\u2014it might not be. But how you show up in the next week is. What would it look like to act as if there's still a chance, even if you're not sure there is?\n\n**Your mom's response:** \"That's just how corporations work\" is technically true and also completely unhelpful when you're the one sitting in the uncertainty. She's trying to reassure you, but it lands as dismissive because she's not the one waiting to find out if her job is safe. The part about eating and sleeping though\u2014she noticed something real. You're up at 3am, stomach's off, not eating well. That's your body under sustained stress. It's not just \"in your head.\" When we're in fight-or-flight for days on end, sleep goes first, then appetite, then everything else starts to fray.\n\nOne thing that might help while you wait for Friday: when you wake up at 3am, don't fight it. Your mind is trying to solve an unsolvable problem (you can't know the outcome yet), so it loops. Instead of lying there spinning, try this\u2014get up, go to another room, write down every single fear your mind is offering. Don't analyze, just dump it all out for 10 minutes. Then go back to bed. Sometimes the brain just needs to feel heard before it'll let you rest. Worth trying?\n\n**Doctor appointment Tuesday:** Glad it got moved up\u2014that's good. And yes, you're probably overthinking it, but also: you won't know until Tuesday, so of course your mind is filling in the gaps. That's what minds do with uncertainty. The chest thing could be anxiety (very common), or it could be something else, and either way the doctor will help you figure it out. You're doing the right thing by getting it checked. Try to hold \"I don't know yet\" instead of letting your mind run the worst-case scenario on repeat.\n\n**Friday's news:** That's the real deadline. Between now and then, you're in limbo, and limbo is brutal. You can't control what they decide, but you can control how you take care of yourself while you wait. Sleep, food, and not letting your mind run unchecked at 3am\u2014those are the things in your control right now. Let's focus there first."

      "user": "ugh. tried the 3am thing you said. wrote stuff down couple nights. honestly helped a bit, fell back asleep faster. so that's something i guess.\n\nbut tuesday happened and doc said its anxiety. not my heart. which is good right, except now im sitting here knowing my body's just... doing this to me because my brain won't shut up about work. feels worse somehow? like at least if it was something physical id have an answer.\n\nanyway. friday's here. they're sending the restructuring details in like an hour. im trying not to think about it but obviously thats not working. hard to focus on anything else. my manager's been weird all morning, keeps walking past my desk. could mean nothing. probably means something. idk.",
      "assistant": "**The 3am writing thing:** Glad that helped, even a little. Your brain needed somewhere to put all that noise, and now it has a place. That's not nothing\u2014falling back asleep faster means you're getting more rest, and rest matters when everything else feels unstable.\n\n**Anxiety diagnosis:** I get why this feels worse instead of better. You wanted a clear problem with a clear fix, and instead you got \"your body is reacting to stress\"\u2014which feels like being told the problem is you. But here's what's actually happening: your chest tightness is real. It's not fake, it's not \"just in your head.\" Your nervous system has been running on high alert for weeks (work uncertainty, sleepless nights, constant vigilance), and your body is doing exactly what bodies do under sustained threat\u2014it's activating the stress response. The tightness, the stomach issues, the sleep disruption\u2014that's all your system trying to protect you. It's not broken. It's doing its job, just in overdrive because the threat (restructuring, job uncertainty) hasn't resolved yet.\n\nSo yes, it's anxiety. But that doesn't mean it's not real or that you're doing something wrong. It means your body needs the threat to pass (or needs you to find a way to turn down the alarm) before it can settle. You're not manufacturing this\u2014you're responding to something genuinely stressful.\n\n**Waiting for the email:** An hour out and your manager keeps walking past your desk. Of course you're spiraling\u2014you're in the final stretch of not knowing, and every small thing (a glance, a walk-by, a tone) feels like a clue. Your mind is doing what it does: trying to predict the outcome so you're not blindsided. But you can't know yet. You will know in an hour.\n\nHere's what might help right now, in this final hour: notice what your body is doing. Are you holding your breath? Clenching your jaw? Shoulders up by your ears? If so, try this\u2014take one long exhale (longer out than in), drop your shoulders deliberately, and say to yourself: \"I'll know in an hour. I don't have to know right now.\" You're not trying to stop the anxiety, just to remind your system that you don't have to solve this yet. The answer is coming. You can let your body rest until it does.\n\nAnd after you read it\u2014whatever it says\u2014come back here. We'll figure out the next step together."

      "user": "got the email. still employed. theyre cutting two people but not me. restructuring the team around \"client-facing roles\" and apparently im one of the people they want to keep. which is... good? i guess i feel relieved but also kinda weird about it. like i spent two weeks convinced i was getting axed and now im supposed to just move on. two guys i know pretty well are getting let go though. feels bad for them but also like\u2014why did i spend all that time freaking out when it was fine.\n\nanyway. my chest thing's mostly gone since i found out. barely noticed it today. so i guess the doc was right, it was just anxiety the whole time. makes sense.\n\nbeen thinking about what you said about asking for things directly instead of waiting. that's probably true but also the whole office just got shuffled around and people are pretty stressed. probably not the right time to push for projects anyway.",
      "assistant": "**Still employed:** That's real relief\u2014two weeks of dread, and you're not getting cut. Your nervous system can finally stand down. And yes, it's good. Let yourself feel that without the \"I guess\" hedge. You kept your job in a restructuring. That means something about how they see your value, even if it doesn't feel clear yet.\n\n**The \"why did I freak out\" question:** You didn't waste two weeks. You were responding to a real threat with incomplete information. Your mind took \"restructuring meeting + vague manager + younger guy getting project\" and ran the most likely story it could build. That's not irrational\u2014that's your brain trying to prepare you for loss. Now you know the outcome, so it feels silly in hindsight. But you didn't have hindsight two weeks ago. You had uncertainty, and uncertainty makes us brace for the worst. You weren't broken for spiraling\u2014you were human.\n\nAlso: the chest tightness is gone. That's your body confirming the threat has passed. The anxiety wasn't \"just\" anything\u2014it was your system responding to something real and unresolved. Now it's resolved, and your body knows.\n\n**Two coworkers getting let go:** That's complicated. Relief that it's not you, guilt that it's them, maybe some survivor's guilt mixed in. It's okay to feel both. You can be glad you're staying and feel bad for them at the same time. Those aren't contradictory\u2014they're just the reality of being the one who made it through a cut.\n\n**Asking for projects timing:** I hear the logic\u2014office is stressed, bad timing to push. But let me push back gently: they just told you they want to keep you for client-facing work. That's the moment when they're thinking about how to use you, not six months from now when things settle. If there's a project you want, this is actually the time to name it\u2014while roles are being redefined and they're figuring out who does what. \"Not the right time\" might be your anxiety talking, trying to keep you small and safe so you don't risk another round of \"what if they don't want me.\" What would it look like to bring it up in the next week, while the restructure is still fresh?"

      "user": "been a few days. work's been weird\u2014like everyone's walking on eggshells, people are pissed about the cuts. jake's actually been pretty cool about it, helped me with something on a client call. maybe i was being unfair about him before.\n\nanyway. been sleeping better. not waking up at 3am anymore which is... nice. stomach's better too. made myself eat breakfast yesterday, that helped. so yeah the anxiety thing makes sense now that the threat's gone.\n\nbeen thinking about what you said about asking for projects directly. keep going back and forth on it. like intellectually i know you're probably right but also feels risky. what if i ask and they say no and then i feel worse about things. easier to just keep my head down and do what i'm doing. they want to keep me so that's enough right? why rock the boat.",
      "assistant": "**Work vibe post-cuts:** Walking on eggshells makes sense\u2014people just watched two colleagues get let go, so everyone's recalibrating what \"safe\" looks like. The anger is real too. You're all processing the same event from different positions (you kept your job, they lost friends/workload increased/trust got shaken). It'll take time for that tension to settle.\n\n**Jake helping you:** That's useful data. You built a story about him (younger guy taking your opportunities), and now he's showing up differently (actually collaborative, helpful on a client call). Doesn't mean your earlier fear was baseless\u2014you were working with limited information and high stakes. But it does mean the story was incomplete. He might not be your competition. He might just be someone doing his job. Worth updating your read on him.\n\n**Sleep and eating:** This is significant. 3am wake-ups gone, stomach settling, actually eating breakfast\u2014your nervous system is coming back online. The threat passed, and your body is returning to baseline. That's how it's supposed to work. You were in crisis mode for two weeks, and now you're not. Let yourself notice that shift. It's evidence that the anxiety wasn't some permanent broken thing\u2014it was a response to circumstances, and when circumstances changed, it resolved.\n\n**Asking for projects\u2014the back and forth:** Here's what I'm hearing: \"Intellectually I know you're right, but what if I ask and they say no?\" That's fear talking. Specifically, fear of confirmation\u2014if you don't ask, you can tell yourself \"I could have gotten it if I'd asked.\" If you do ask and they say no, then you have to sit with \"they don't see me that way.\" That's scarier, because it makes the rejection real instead of hypothetical.\n\nBut let's test that fear. What actually happens if you ask and they say no? You feel bad for a bit, yeah. But you also know where you stand. And you've signaled that you want more\u2014which matters, because managers aren't mind readers. If you never ask, they assume you're content. If you ask and they say no, at least you've put it on the record that you're interested in growth. That's not nothing.\n\nNow flip it: what happens if you don't ask? You keep your head down, stay \"safe,\" avoid the risk of hearing no. But six months from now, when someone else gets the project, you'll be right back here: \"Why didn't they pick me? I've been here longer. I guess they don't value me.\" And you won't know if it's because they don't value you or because you never told them what you wanted.\n\n\"They want to keep me so that's enough right?\"\u2014Is it? You're the only one who can answer that. If you're genuinely satisfied doing what you're doing, then yes, it's enough. But if part of you wants more (and it sounds like part of you does, given you've been asking for that client project for months), then \"keeping my head down\" isn't enough. It's just safe.\n\nWhat would it look like to ask in a way that feels lower-risk? Maybe not \"I need this project,\" but \"I'm interested in doing more client-facing work, especially [specific type]. Are there opportunities coming up where that'd be a fit?\" That's not demanding\u2014it's expressing interest and asking for information. They can say yes, no, or \"not right now but let's revisit.\" All of those are useful answers. And none of them are catastrophic."

That's disorienting\u2014you were ready for one conversation and got a completely different one. And now your mind is doing what it does: reverse-engineering what \"better fit for my skillset\" really means. Could be code for \"you're not fitting in,\" sure. Or it could mean exactly what it says\u2014they looked at the restructure, looked at what you're good at, and saw a spot where you'd do better work. You won't know which until you see what the new team actually is.\n\nHere's what I'd focus on: what did he say about the new role specifically? What kind of work? What team? If it's vague (\"we'll get you details soon\"), that's worth following up on\u2014\"I'd like to understand more about what this role involves and why you see it as a good fit.\" You're allowed to ask clarifying questions. You're not being shuffled arbitrarily\u2014this is your career, and you get to understand the move before you accept the narrative your mind is writing about it.\n\nAnd if part of you is worried this is a sideways demotion, test it directly: \"Is this move a step forward for me, or more of a lateral shift?\" Managers expect that question during restructures. Asking it doesn't make you look insecure\u2014it makes you look like someone who cares about their trajectory.\n\n**Sleep and stress recalibration:** Sleeping through the night, no 3am wake-ups, chest completely fine\u2014your system has fully reset. The existential \"am I getting fired\" threat is gone, and what's left is regular work stress (the kind that doesn't wake you up at 3am or send you to the doctor). That's a huge shift. You moved from crisis mode to baseline in two weeks. Let yourself notice that you're capable of that\u2014your body can come back down when the threat resolves.\n\n**Your mom's \"I told you it was in your head\":** Technically right, emotionally tone-deaf. Yes, it was anxiety. But \"in your head\" implies it wasn't real or wasn't justified. Your chest pain was real. Your body was responding to sustained uncertainty about your job, your financial stability, your worth at work\u2014all real things. The fact that it was anxiety-driven doesn't make it imaginary. It just means the solution wasn't cardiac, it was resolving the stressor (which you did by surviving the restructure). She's trying to reassure you in hindsight, but it probably lands as minimizing what you went through. You don't need to correct her, but you also don't need to internalize her framing."

      "assistant": "**The promotion details:** So \"better fit\" actually meant better\u2014more senior, strategy work, pay bump. Your brain took ambiguity and filled it with threat (\"they're shuffling me out\"), but the reality was opportunity. That's worth noticing, not just for this situation, but as a pattern: when your mind doesn't have full information, it defaults to the worst interpretation. It did that with the restructuring (assumed you'd be cut), with Jake (assumed he was taking your spot), and now with the team move (assumed it was a demotion). Each time, the actual outcome was less catastrophic than the story you built. Your pattern is: uncertainty = danger. Knowing that doesn't make it stop, but it does help you catch it earlier next time.\n\n**\"Why now, after 15 years?\":** This question makes sense\u201415 years of feeling overlooked, and suddenly a promotion feels suspicious instead of validating. But here's another way to look at it: restructures force organizations to reassess everyone. They had to look at the whole team with fresh eyes and decide who goes where. In that process, they saw you clearly\u2014probably for the first time in a while\u2014and put you somewhere that uses what you're actually good at. It's not that they suddenly \"discovered\" your value. It's that the restructure created an opening, and you were the right fit for it. Sometimes it takes a shake-up for people to see what was there all along.\n\nAs for \"or are they just moving problem people around\"\u2014you got a senior role with a pay bump. That's not where organizations put people they're trying to hide. If you were a problem, they would've cut you two weeks ago when they had the chance. They didn't. They promoted you. Let that be the data.\n\n**Starting over stress:** New team, new people, new projects\u2014that's real. You're trading the comfort of knowing how things work for the uncertainty of proving yourself again. That's inherently stressful, even when it's a good move. One thing that might help: you're not actually starting from zero. You're coming in with 15 years of experience, institutional knowledge, and a mandate to do strategy work. You're not the new junior person trying to earn a seat. You're the senior person they moved into a role they needed filled. That's a different position. What would it look like to show up as that person, instead of as someone who has to prove they belong?\n\n**Your body's doing well:** Chest fine, sleep fine\u2014your system is stable now that the acute threat has passed. That's exactly how it should work. The fact that your body responded to stress and then recovered when the stress resolved isn't a flaw. It's your system working as designed.\n\n**Your mom:** She doesn't get the nuances of the work stuff, but she noticed you were struggling and she's staying in touch. That's her way of caring, even if it's clunky. You don't have to explain everything to her, but it sounds like having someone check in\u2014even if it's a little annoying\u2014isn't the worst thing right now."

You'll probably see the pattern\u2014your mind goes negative by default when there's uncertainty. Seeing it on paper can help you catch it faster next time and give yourself other options besides catastrophizing.\n\n**Manager not bringing you into strategy yet:** It's been a week. He's onboarding you with smaller projects first\u2014that's standard. You don't hand someone the high-stakes work on day one, even if they're senior. He's letting you learn the team, the context, the communication style before throwing you into the deep end. That's actually good management, not evidence that he doesn't think you're ready.\n\nBut I hear the fear underneath: \"maybe they oversold the role, maybe I'm not actually what they wanted.\" That's the same uncertainty loop\u2014your mind looking for confirmation that you don't belong. Here's a different frame: what if he's doing exactly what he should be doing, and in a few weeks you'll be in the strategy work, and this will have just been normal onboarding? What would need to happen for you to trust that's the more likely explanation?\n\nIf you're still worried about it in another week or two, you could ask directly: \"I'm excited to get into more of the strategy work we discussed. What's the timeline for ramping me up on that?\" That's not insecure\u2014it's clarifying expectations. But give it a little more time first. One week is too early to conclude anything.\n\n**Physical stability:** Chest still fine, sleep still stable\u2014your body has stayed regulated even as you started the new role. That's huge. A month ago, this kind of transition (new team, new uncertainty) might have sent you into another spiral. But you're noticing the anxious thoughts without the physical symptoms escalating. That means you've built some resilience. The thoughts are still loud, but your body isn't amplifying them into panic. That's progress."

      "assistant": "**The tracking experiment:** Five days is enough to see the pattern\u2014your brain defaults to worst-case when there's ambiguity. You didn't need to do it forever; you got what you needed from it (confirmation that the catastrophizing is a habit, not reality). And now you have that awareness. Next time you notice the \"oh great, they think I'm incompetent\" spike, you'll recognize it faster as your pattern, not as truth. That's the skill\u2014not stopping the thought, but catching it and asking \"is this data or is this my anxiety filling in gaps?\"\n\n**Strategy meeting:** You were in the room, you weren't out of place, the role is real. That's the evidence. A month ago you were convinced the \"better fit\" language was code for a demotion. Two weeks ago you worried he oversold the role. Now you're in strategy meetings doing the work they said you'd do. Your fear kept saying \"it's not real, they don't actually want you,\" and the reality keeps saying \"yes they do, here's the proof.\" Let that update your story about what's happening here.\n\n**Your mom:** This is a nice shift. She's been calling more, and instead of it feeling intrusive, it's landing as care. And then you told her about the tracking thing and she said \"I do that too\"\u2014suddenly she's not just the person who dismisses your anxiety as \"in your head,\" she's someone who gets anxious and has her own strategies. That reframe matters. She wasn't minimizing you before because she doesn't understand anxiety\u2014she was trying to reassure you the way she reassures herself. It didn't land well in the moment, but now you're seeing her differently. That's connection. Sometimes it takes a crisis to realize the people around us are more like us than we thought.\n\n**\"Life's just normal now\":** A month ago you were convinced you were getting fired, your chest hurt, you weren't sleeping, you were catastrophizing every interaction. Now: new role, stable sleep, no physical symptoms, able to catch your anxious thoughts before they spiral, closer to your mom, showing up at work without constant dread. Normal feels boring after a month of crisis, but normal is actually what you were fighting for. Let yourself have it. You earned this."

      "user": "so been thinking about what you said about my mom. like shes anxious too and i never really clocked that before. we talked on the phone yesterday and she was asking about the strategy meeting and i actually told her about it instead of just saying \"fine\" and moving on. she asked good questions, way better than i expected.\n\nbut then today at work something happened and i kinda spiraled a bit. manager asked me to revise something i submitted and i immediately thought like \"oh shit, hes not happy with my work, this is it.\" but then i remembered the tracking thing\u2014what actually happened was he asked for revisions. thats it. not \"youre failing,\" just \"revise this.\" so i did it, sent it back. he seemed fine with it.\n\nweird thing is i caught myself doing the projection thing. like i was assuming he thought i was incompetent, but really i was the one doubting myself. projecting my own doubt onto him. does that make sense or am I reading too much into it?\n\nanyway. chest is good. sleeping through every night now. new team stuff is actually clicking. life is just... different than it was a month ago. way less catastrophizing happening in my head.",
      "assistant": "**Your mom conversation:** That's a real shift\u2014moving from \"fine\" autopilot to actually telling her about the strategy meeting, and then she asked good questions. You're discovering she's more capable of understanding your world than you gave her credit for. And the reframe you had (she's anxious too, she gets it) is letting you show up differently with her. That's not a small thing. You're building a different kind of relationship with her in real time.\n\n**The revision request spiral:** This is exactly the skill in action. Manager asks for revisions \u2192 your mind jumps to \"he's not happy, this is it\" \u2192 you pause, check what actually happened (just a revision request, normal work stuff) \u2192 you do the work, send it back, he's fine with it. A month ago, that spiral might have turned into a full anxiety loop (chest tightness, 3am catastrophizing, days of dread). This time you caught it, tested it against reality, and kept moving. That's the difference between being controlled by the anxiety and having some space around it.\n\n**Projection insight:** Yes, that makes complete sense\u2014and it's a sharp observation. You assumed he thought you were incompetent, but the doubt was coming from you, not from anything he said or did. That's textbook projection: you were feeling uncertain about your work, so you attributed that uncertainty to him. Your mind needed somewhere to put the doubt, so it put it on him (\"he thinks I'm failing\") instead of sitting with \"I'm not sure if this is good enough yet.\" Catching that in the moment is huge. Most people never notice they're doing it. You noticed, named it, and adjusted. That's self-awareness turning into actual change.\n\nOne thing to watch: when you catch yourself projecting doubt onto someone else, it's often a sign that you're being harder on yourself than the situation warrants. If your internal voice is saying \"I'm incompetent\" and you're projecting that onto your manager, the real question is\u2014where's that voice coming from? What standard are you holding yourself to that makes one revision request feel like proof of failure? You don't have to answer that now, but it's worth sitting with. The projection is a symptom; the real issue might be how harshly you're judging yourself.\n\n**A month ago vs. now:** Let's just take stock for a second. A month ago: convinced you were getting fired, chest pain, doctor visit, not sleeping, not eating, catastrophizing every signal at work, 3am wake-ups, constant dread. Now: new role, strategy work, sleeping through the night, catching anxious thoughts before they spiral, closer relationship with your mom, able to name projection in real time, physical symptoms gone. You didn't just survive the restructuring\u2014you actually came through it with more insight and more skills than you had going in. That's not nothing. Let yourself see that."

      "assistant": "**The revisions cycle:** Second round of revisions, no spiral, just did the work, manager seemed happy. That's the new baseline forming\u2014revisions are part of the job, not evidence of failure. You're building proof for yourself that you can handle normal work friction without it turning into an existential crisis. That shift from \"this means I'm failing\" to \"this is just work\" is exactly what rewiring the pattern looks like.\n\n**Manager's comment about you:** Your coworker told you the manager said you're settling in well and bringing good perspective. That's straightforward positive feedback, delivered secondhand. But your mind immediately went to: \"Was he just being nice? Why would my coworker tell me unless there's subtext?\" Here's what I'm noticing\u2014you just did the projection thing again, but this time with positive feedback. When the feedback is critical (or neutral, like a revision request), your mind says \"he thinks I'm incompetent.\" When the feedback is actually positive, your mind says \"he's just being nice, what's the real story?\" Either way, you discount it. You're not letting good news be good news.\n\nSo let me ask: what would your manager have to say or do for you to believe he actually thinks you're doing well? If \"settling in well, brings good perspective\" isn't enough, and your mind is already looking for subtext or hidden meaning\u2014what evidence would convince you? Because if the bar is \"nothing will ever convince me,\" then you're stuck in a loop where you can never feel secure, no matter what reality shows you.\n\nAs for why your coworker told you\u2014maybe because people generally share positive things they hear about their colleagues? It's not that deep. He heard something nice, passed it along. You're allowed to just take it as what it is: your manager thinks you're doing well, and your coworker thought you'd want to know. That's it.\n\n**Your mom:** Twenty minutes of nothing-important life stuff, and it felt normal and good. Then you shared the projection insight and she said \"yeah I do that all the time, especially with your dad.\" That's beautiful\u2014she's not just listening, she's reflecting back her own version of the same struggle. You're connecting as two people who both deal with anxiety, not as \"kid who's struggling\" and \"parent who reassures.\" That's a different kind of closeness. And the fact that it made you feel less alone\u2014that's what connection does. You're not the only one whose brain does this. She gets it, because hers does it too.\n\n**Tired vs. anxiety-tired:** Yeah, that difference is real. Anxiety-tired is \"I didn't sleep because my mind was racing and my chest hurt and I couldn't shut down.\" Regular tired is \"I'm just tired because it's been a long day/week.\" Your body knows the difference, and so do you. The fact that you can name it as regular tired\u2014not a symptom, just normal human exhaustion\u2014means you're not in crisis mode anymore. You're just living."

      "assistant": "**The hypervigilance fading:** Ten days in and the \"everyone's judging me\" feeling is way quieter\u2014you're not even noticing it half the time now. That's not a small shift. A month ago that voice was running constantly, scanning every interaction for evidence of threat. Now it's background noise, and sometimes it's not even there. That's your nervous system recalibrating to \"work is not a constant threat.\" The pattern is still there (it doesn't vanish overnight), but it's losing power. You're building a new baseline.\n\n**Leading the strategy session:** Your manager asked you to lead a strategy session next week. That's a vote of confidence\u2014he's putting you in a visible role where you set the agenda and guide the conversation. But your mind took it and flipped it: \"Why would he ask if he actually thought I was ready? Probably testing me to see if I'll mess up.\" Notice what just happened\u2014you got handed evidence that he trusts you (he's giving you a leadership role), and your anxiety immediately reframed it as a setup for failure.\n\nHere's the reality check: if he wanted to test whether you'd mess up, he wouldn't put you in front of the team in a high-stakes strategy session. That's not how managers operate. If he had doubts, he'd keep you in the background, observing, doing smaller tasks. The fact that he's giving you this role means he thinks you can handle it. Your fear is doing the same thing it did with the promotion, the team move, the positive feedback\u2014it's discounting good news and searching for hidden danger.\n\nSo yes, you might mess up. That's always possible. But \"I might mess up\" is not the same as \"he's setting me up to fail.\" One is normal pre-presentation nerves. The other is catastrophizing. Which one is actually true here?\n\nOne thing that might help before next week: instead of rehearsing all the ways it could go wrong, try this\u2014write down what a decent-enough session would look like. Not perfect, just good enough. What are the 2-3 things you want to accomplish? What does success actually require? You're probably holding yourself to some impossible standard (\"I have to be flawless or I'll prove I don't belong\"), and that's what's making you spiral. If you define \"good enough\" ahead of time, it's easier to hit it and not get lost in the catastrophizing.\n\n**Your mom calling more:** She's asking you to dinner this weekend, she's calling more often, and now you're wondering if she's hovering or worried about you relapsing. Could be. Or could be that the last month showed her you were really struggling, and now she's staying more connected because she cares and wants to make sure you're okay. That's not necessarily hovering\u2014that's just a parent recalibrating after watching their kid go through something hard.\n\nBut here's the thing: if it feels like too much, you can tell her. \"Hey, I appreciate you checking in\u2014it's been really helpful. I'm doing better now, so you don't need to worry as much.\" You're allowed to set a boundary without it being a rejection. She'll probably be relieved to hear you're actually okay, not just saying you're okay.\n\nOr if the calls feel good and you're just second-guessing whether they should feel good\u2014let them feel good. You've been building a closer relationship with her over the last few weeks. Maybe this is just what that looks like. Not every increase in contact is a red flag. Sometimes people just stay in touch more when they've reconnected.\n\n**\"Just tired from thinking about the session\":** Chest is fine, everything's fine, but you're tired from pre-worrying about the session. That's anticipatory anxiety\u2014your mind is running the session over and over, trying to prepare for every possible disaster. It's exhausting because you're living it multiple times before it even happens. One thing to try: set a timer for 10 minutes, write down every single fear about the session (all the ways it could go wrong, all the things you're worried about), then close the document and don't look at it again until after the session is over. Your brain just wants to be heard. Once it's dumped everything out, it might actually let you rest instead of running the same loops on repeat."

      "assistant": "**The strategy session:** It went fine\u2014you led it, people engaged, asked questions, manager seemed satisfied. That's not \"fine,\" that's actually good. You did the thing you were anxious about, and it went well. But instead of letting that land, your mind immediately moved the goalpost: \"one good session doesn't prove anything, next time might be different.\" Notice what's happening\u2014you're not allowing the evidence to update your story. The session going well should mean something (like: \"I can handle this role, the manager was right to give me this opportunity\"), but your anxiety is saying \"this data doesn't count, you still have to prove yourself forever.\"\n\nHere's the truth: one good session doesn't prove you'll nail every session for the rest of your career. But it does prove you can lead a strategy session competently. That's new data. A month ago you weren't doing this at all. Now you've done it once and it went well. That's called building a track record. You don't need to be perfect every time\u2014you just need to show up and do decent work, which is exactly what you did. Let that count for something.\n\n**Discounting good news pattern:** You asked \"is that normal or am I broken or what.\" It's normal\u2014it's a cognitive pattern called \"discounting the positive,\" and it's extremely common in people who've been anxious for a while. Your brain has been scanning for threats for so long (months? years?) that it doesn't know how to process good news. Good news feels unstable, like it could be taken away, so your mind discounts it preemptively to avoid disappointment. \"If I don't count this win, I can't be let down when things go bad again.\"\n\nBut here's the cost: if you never let yourself acknowledge what's going well, you're constantly operating from a deficit. You'll never feel secure, no matter how much evidence piles up that you're doing fine, because your brain has already decided the evidence doesn't count. The session went well? Doesn't count. Manager gave positive feedback? Doesn't count. Got promoted? Doesn't count. At some point you have to ask: what would it take for me to believe I'm actually doing okay? Because if the bar is \"nothing will ever be enough,\" then you're stuck in permanent insecurity, even when reality says otherwise.\n\nYou're not broken. Your brain is just running an outdated protection system. It worked when the threat was real (restructuring, job insecurity), but now the threat is gone and the system is still running. You're catching it in real time (\"my brain won't let me have the win\"), which means you're aware of it. That's the first step. The second step is deciding to let the good news count, even when your anxiety says it doesn't. Try this: when you catch yourself discounting something good, say out loud (or write it down): \"The session went well. That's true, and I'm letting it be true.\" You don't have to feel great about it\u2014just practice not erasing it.\n\n**Your mom:** You told her the calling felt like a lot sometimes, and she said \"oh sorry, I can back off\"\u2014which wasn't what you meant, so now you feel bad. But then you clarified (or at least you're planning to at dinner), and now you're actually looking forward to seeing her. That's repair in action. You set a boundary that didn't land quite right, it felt awkward, but you're working through it instead of letting it fester. That's how real relationships work\u2014you say something clumsy, the other person responds, you adjust, and you keep going. The fact that you can have that conversation with her (instead of just silently resenting the calls or pulling away) says something about the trust you've built with her over the last few weeks.\n\n**Physical baseline:** Chest is fine, no anxiety symptoms\u2014just frustrated with your own head. That's a good problem to have, honestly. It means your body has fully settled, and what's left is the cognitive habit (the discounting, the goalpost-moving, the \"what if next time\" spiraling). Those habits take longer to shift than the physical symptoms, but they do shift. You've already started catching them. Now it's about practicing a different response when they show up. You're not broken\u2014you're just learning a new skill."

You've been building this over the last few weeks (the anxiety conversation, the projection thing, the dinner boundary), and now it's paying off\u2014you're both showing up more honestly with each other.\n\n**Second strategy session:** It went fine, you caught yourself starting to discount it, and then you stopped and said \"ok it went well, that's the data.\" That's exactly the skill. You noticed the pattern (discounting good news), you interrupted it, and you practiced a different response (letting it count). It felt weird because you're not used to letting wins be wins\u2014but you did it anyway. That's not a small thing. You're actively rewiring the habit, one session at a time.\n\n**\"Am I gonna be like this forever?\":** This question makes sense after a month of hell\u2014chest pain, 3am spirals, obsessing about the restructuring, convincing yourself you were getting fired. It took up so much headspace, and now you're wondering if you're just one crisis away from it happening again. But here's what I want you to notice: you didn't stay in the spiral. You moved through it. A month ago you were in crisis mode\u2014physical symptoms, catastrophizing every signal, not sleeping, not eating. Now: new role, stable sleep, catching anxious thoughts before they take over, closer to your mom, able to accept good news (even when it feels weird). You didn't just survive the crisis\u2014you came out of it with more tools than you had going in.\n\nSo yes, another crisis might trigger anxiety again. That's how anxiety works\u2014it responds to real threats. But the difference is, next time you'll recognize it faster. You'll know it's your pattern (uncertainty = catastrophizing), you'll have the tracking tool, you'll catch the projection, you'll know the difference between \"my mind is filling in gaps\" and \"this is actual data.\" You won't be starting from zero. You'll be starting from here, with everything you've learned in the last month.\n\nAs for \"people don't really change that much\"\u2014that's your anxiety talking, trying to lock in a pessimistic story so you don't get your hopes up. But look at the evidence: a month ago you couldn't let good news land, and yesterday you practiced accepting it even though it felt weird. A month ago you saw your mom as someone who dismissed your struggles, and this week you sat and listened to her work drama because you realized she's got her own stuff going on. A month ago a revision request sent you spiraling, and now you can do revisions without it turning into an existential crisis. Those are changes. Small, real, meaningful changes. You don't have to become a different person\u2014you're just learning to respond differently when your brain does its thing. That's enough."
