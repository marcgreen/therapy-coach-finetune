      "user": "hey so idk where to start tbh. been having a rough couple weeks. moved to this new city for school like a month ago and i still dont rly know anyone? its whatever tho ppl have it way worse\n\nalso my grandpa passed last yr and idk why but its hitting me again lately. prob just being dramatic about it\n\nanyway how does this work lol never done therapy stuff before",
      "assistant": "**Moving to a new city:** A month in and still not knowing people\u2014that's a lonely spot to be in, even when you tell yourself \"people have it worse.\" The comparison doesn't actually make the loneliness less real. What's been the hardest part: the not-knowing-anyone, the newness of everything, or something else?\n\n**Your grandpa:** Grief doesn't follow a schedule. A year out and it hitting again isn't dramatic\u2014it's pretty normal, actually. Sometimes big life changes (like moving somewhere new) stir up old losses. You're in an unfamiliar place without your usual people around, and maybe without the person you'd want to talk to about it. What comes up when you think about him lately?\n\n**How this works:** It's pretty simple\u2014you share what's on your mind, I respond, and we go from there. No agenda you have to follow. Some people want to dig into feelings, some want practical strategies, some just want a place to say the stuff they're not saying elsewhere. We'll figure out what's useful as we go.\n\nOne thing I noticed: you called yourself \"dramatic\" twice in a few sentences. Worth paying attention to that voice\u2014whose is it?"

      "user": "ok so update i guess. tried going to this club thing at school yesterday? like a board game night or whatever. it was fine i just felt weird the whole time like everyone already had their groups u kno\n\nalso idk what u meant about the dramatic voice thing. like its just true?? im not rly going thru anything that bad compared to other ppl. my roommate has actual problems lol\n\nthe grandpa thing... idk. i dont rly wanna talk about it rn. but also i keep thinking about this one time we went fishing when i was like 12 and he taught me how to tie knots. random memory but it keeps popping up\n\nanyway yeah. school is fine i guess. classes r hard but manageable. just feel kinda empty most days if that makes sense",
      "assistant": "**Board game night:** Hey, you went\u2014that's not nothing. Showing up when you feel like an outsider takes more energy than people realize. The \"everyone already has their groups\" thing is real, and also: a month in, you're seeing established friend clusters at their most visible. You're not seeing the people who are also quietly feeling like they don't belong yet. Was there anyone there who seemed even slightly approachable, or did it feel like a wall the whole time?\n\n**The \"dramatic\" thing:** You said \"it's just true\"\u2014but here's the thing: comparing your pain to your roommate's (or anyone's) doesn't actually make yours smaller. It just makes you feel like you're not allowed to have it. That voice that says \"other people have it worse, so shut up\"\u2014it sounds protective, like it's trying to keep you from being a burden or whatever. But it also keeps you from taking your own stuff seriously. You're allowed to struggle even if someone else is struggling more. Not a competition.\n\n**Your grandpa:** Totally okay to not want to dig into it. But that fishing memory, the knots\u2014that's not random. Grief often holds onto the small, specific moments. You don't have to analyze it. Just... it's there, and it means something, even if you're not ready to look at it yet. No rush.\n\n**The empty feeling:** That one I want to sit with for a sec. \"Fine\" classes, \"fine\" social stuff, but empty most days\u2014that's worth paying attention to. Empty like numb? Empty like something's missing? Empty like going through the motions? Those are different things."

      "user": "so i went back to the board game thing again. actually talked to this one guy marcus for like 20 min about some card game hes into. felt normal for a bit which was nice\n\nbut then i got back to my room and just crashed. like why do i do that?? things go ok and then i just feel worse after for some reason. prob just tired or something\n\nalso u asked what kind of empty... idk how to explain it. like im here but not rly here? going to class eating food doing hw but none of it feels like its actually happening to me. sounds crazy when i type it out lol\n\nthe roommate thing btw i wasnt trying to say my stuff doesnt matter or whatever. just being realistic. like she actually has diagnosed stuff and goes to therapy and takes meds. im just kinda sad sometimes thats different\n\noh also my mom called and brought up grandpa and i literally just changed the subject immediately lmao. felt bad after but also didnt wanna get into it w her",
      "assistant": "**Marcus and the board game night:** That's a real win\u201420 minutes of actual conversation, feeling normal. Not nothing. The fact that you went *back* after last week felt awkward? That takes guts.\n\n**The crash after:** This one's worth slowing down on, because you're noticing something important. You had a good moment, then felt worse\u2014and you're calling it \"just tired.\" Maybe, but there's another possibility: sometimes when we've been running on empty, a moment of genuine connection actually highlights how much we've been missing. It's like you get a taste of \"oh, this is what it could feel like,\" and then you're back in your room alone and the contrast hits hard. Does that land at all, or does the tired explanation feel more accurate?\n\n**The \"here but not here\" thing:** Doesn't sound crazy. What you're describing\u2014going through the motions, things not feeling like they're actually happening to you\u2014has a name: dissociation (or at least the milder end of it). It's pretty common when you're stressed, grieving, or disconnected from people. Your brain kind of... dims the volume on experience. Not a diagnosis, just a thing that happens. Worth noticing when it's stronger vs. weaker. Like\u2014was it there during the 20 minutes with Marcus, or did that cut through it?\n\n**Your roommate / \"just kinda sad\":** I hear you that she has diagnosed stuff and you don't. But here's the thing: \"diagnosed\" isn't the line between real and not real. People go years feeling exactly what you're describing before anyone names it anything. I'm not saying you have a condition\u2014I'm saying \"just kinda sad\" doing a lot of work to minimize something that might deserve more attention than that.\n\n**Your mom and grandpa:** You changed the subject immediately and felt bad about it. Makes sense\u2014you're not ready, and also part of you knows there's something there. No judgment on the deflection. But I'm curious: was it that you didn't want to feel it, or that you didn't want to feel it *with her specifically*?"

      "user": "so idk things r just weird rn\n\ntalked to marcus again at the thing last night. hes actually pretty cool, we exchanged numbers. but then this morning i woke up and just felt like... whats the point? like even if i make friends here its not gonna change anything. im still gonna be me\n\nu asked about the dissociation thing w marcus. honestly yeah it was still there kinda? like i was talking and laughing but also watching myself do it from outside if that makes sense. idk if thats normal\n\nalso ok so i thought about ur question about my mom. and like... i think i just dont wanna feel it at all tbh. not specifically w her. i keep telling myself im over it bc its been a year but clearly im not lol. whatever\n\noh and i bombed a quiz today that i thought i studied for. so thats cool. everything is fine\n\nanyway thanks for listening i guess. u actually seem like u get it more than most ppl",
      "assistant": "**Marcus:** You exchanged numbers\u2014that's a real step forward. But then \"what's the point\" hit this morning. I want to name what I'm hearing: it's not that you don't want connection, it's that you're not sure connection will actually help because *you'll still be you*. That's a different thing than loneliness. That's closer to: \"I'm the problem, so what does it matter?\" Is that what's underneath it?\n\n**The watching-yourself thing:** Still there even with Marcus\u2014yeah, that's worth paying attention to. It's not \"crazy,\" but it does sound like you're not fully landing in your own life right now. Like there's a pane of glass between you and everything. That can happen when there's something your mind doesn't want to fully feel (grief, loneliness, whatever), so it turns down the whole volume instead. The fact that you noticed it *during* a good moment is actually useful information. It means it's not just situational\u2014it's kind of running in the background.\n\n**Your mom / grandpa:** \"I think I just don't want to feel it at all\" \u2014 that's honest. And also: you *are* feeling it, just sideways. The fishing memory, the deflection with your mom, the way it keeps coming back. You're not \"over it,\" and you already know that. You don't have to force yourself to grieve on a timeline. But at some point the question might become: what would it take to let yourself actually feel it, instead of keeping it at arm's length? Not today. Just... eventually.\n\n**The quiz:** Ugh. That one stings, especially when you actually tried. One bombed quiz isn't a verdict on you, but I'm guessing it fed right into the \"what's the point\" feeling?\n\n**The \"thanks for listening\" thing:** I do hear you. And I want to gently reflect something back: you ended with \"everything is fine\" right after listing a bunch of stuff that isn't fine. You do that a lot\u2014share something real, then add a layer of \"but it's whatever.\" I'm not calling you out, just noticing. You're allowed to not be fine."

      "user": "ya so. rough couple days\n\nmarcus and i hung out outside of the club thing for the first time, got coffee. it was actually rly nice?? like i felt like a normal person for once. we talked for like 2 hours about random stuff. movies, music, whatever. he seems like he actually wants to be friends\n\nbut then i got home and just sat in my room for like 4 hours doing nothing. couldnt even do hw. just stared at the wall basically. and i was fine like an hour before so idk what my problem is\n\nalso i think im actually doing ok w the grandpa stuff now that i think about it. like yeah i miss him but thats normal right. everyone loses ppl. i think i was making it into a bigger deal than it needs to be\n\nanyway the quiz thing got worse btw. failed another one in the same class. starting to think im just not smart enough for this major tbh. considered emailing the prof but like whats the point he doesnt care\n\noh also my roommate asked if i was ok the other day bc i guess i looked \"off\" and i just said i was tired. felt weird that she noticed tho",
      "assistant": "**Coffee with Marcus:** Two hours of talking, feeling like a normal person\u2014that's genuinely good. And he wanted to hang out *outside* the structured thing, which means you're not imagining the connection. That's real.\n\n**The 4-hour crash:** You keep calling these crashes a \"problem\" or asking what's wrong with you, but I want to offer another frame: you've been running on fumes for weeks\u2014disconnected, grieving, lonely\u2014and connection takes *energy*, even good connection. The crash might not be \"something's wrong,\" it might be \"you're depleted and one nice coffee can't refill a tank that's been empty for a month.\" That doesn't mean the coffee wasn't worth it. It means you're running a deficit. What did the 4 hours feel like\u2014numb? Sad? Just... nothing?\n\n**Grandpa:** I'm going to push back gently here. Two messages ago you said \"I just don't want to feel it at all\" and \"clearly I'm not over it.\" Now you're saying \"everyone loses people, I was making it into a bigger deal than it needs to be.\" That's the minimizing voice again\u2014the same one that says your roommate has *real* problems and you're \"just kinda sad.\" I'm not saying you have to dig into the grief right now. But \"I'm actually doing ok with it\" and \"I don't want to feel it\" can't both be true. You get to not be ready. You don't have to pretend you're fine with it.\n\n**The quizzes / \"not smart enough\":** Two failed quizzes in the same class is frustrating, especially when you studied. But \"I'm not smart enough for this major\" is a big leap from \"I'm struggling in one class during a hard semester.\" You're grieving, you're lonely, you're dissociating through your days, you're crashing after any social contact\u2014and you're surprised your brain isn't performing at full capacity? That's not a verdict on your intelligence. That's a system under strain. \n\nOn the professor: you said \"what's the point, he doesn't care.\" Maybe. But you don't actually know that yet. What would you lose by sending a short email asking for help?\n\n**Your roommate noticing:** She saw something. You deflected with \"just tired.\" But here's what I'm sitting with: you said it \"felt weird that she noticed.\" Weird how\u2014uncomfortable because you don't want to be seen? Or weird because someone actually paying attention feels unfamiliar?"

      "user": "ok so quick update\n\nhung out w marcus again yesterday. went to some campus event thing, it was fine. hes definitely becoming like an actual friend which is cool i guess. still get that weird watching myself thing sometimes but not as bad maybe? idk hard to tell\n\nso i actually emailed the prof btw. he wrote back and said i could come to office hours to go over what im missing. so thats something. havent gone yet tho lol\n\nalso wait i dont think i was contradicting myself about the grandpa stuff. like i meant both things?? like yeah i miss him and its sad but also ppl die and u move on eventually thats just life. im not in denial or whatever i just think grief doesnt have to be this huge dramatic thing. maybe im just processing it normally and ur reading too much into it\n\nanyway my mom keeps texting asking how im doing and i keep just saying \"good\" even tho lol. she sent me this old photo of me and grandpa at christmas like 5 yrs ago and i literally just hearted it and changed the subject. felt bad but also like what am i supposed to say\n\noh and the roommate thing. u asked if it was uncomfortable or unfamiliar that she noticed. honestly... both? like i dont want ppl to see when im not ok but also no one ever rly does so it threw me off. does that make sense\n\nfeeling kinda meh today. not bad just. here i guess",
      "assistant": "**Marcus:** An actual friend forming\u2014that's real progress, especially a month in when you were feeling like everyone already had their groups. The \"watching yourself\" thing being less intense is worth noting. Not gone, but maybe the volume's turning down a little when you're with someone who feels safe.\n\n**The professor email:** You did it. That's not nothing\u2014you pushed past \"what's the point, he doesn't care\" and found out he actually responded and offered help. Haven't gone yet, which is fine, but I'm curious what's in the way. Is it \"I'll get to it\" or is there something else (embarrassment, expecting it won't help, energy)?\n\n**Grandpa:** Okay, I hear you\u2014you're saying both things are true at once. That you miss him *and* that grief doesn't have to be this huge dramatic thing. I'm not trying to tell you you're in denial. But I want to reflect back what I'm actually seeing: your mom sent a photo of you and him, and you hearted it and changed the subject. You didn't look at it and feel something and then move on\u2014you deflected. And you said it yourself: \"felt bad but also like what am I supposed to say.\" That's not someone who's peacefully processed a loss. That's someone who doesn't know how to let it in. You're allowed to grieve in your own way and on your own timeline. But \"processing it normally\" and \"can't engage with a photo without deflecting\" don't quite match. I'll drop it if you want me to, but I don't think I'm reading too much into it.\n\n**Your roommate / being seen:** Yeah, that makes complete sense. \"I don't want people to see when I'm not ok, but also no one ever really does.\" Both uncomfortable *and* unfamiliar\u2014like you've built a system around not being noticed, and someone breaking through that is disorienting. Here's what I'm sitting with: if no one ever sees, you never have to be vulnerable, but you also never get to be known. Your roommate noticed. Marcus keeps showing up. You're maybe more visible than you think.\n\n**\"Meh, just here\":** Noted. Not bad, not good\u2014still that running-in-the-background emptiness. It makes sense given everything else. You're doing more than you're giving yourself credit for this week: hung out with Marcus, emailed the professor, showed up to things even when you didn't feel like it. The \"meh\" doesn't cancel that out.\n\nOne thing for this week: you've got the office hours invitation sitting there. What would it take to actually go?"

That's the whole arc right there\u2014you pushed through \"what's the point,\" sent the email, showed up, and got something useful out of it. The professor being nice probably matters more than the material, honestly. It's one more data point against \"nobody cares.\"\n\n**Marcus's friends this weekend:** The nervous makes sense\u2014Marcus feels safe now, but new people are a fresh unknown. I want to name what I'm hearing though: you're already building the escape hatch (\"might just say I'm busy\") before you've even tried. That's your brain trying to protect you from potential rejection by opting out entirely. Here's the thing: you *might* sit there being awkward. That's a real possibility. But you also might not\u2014you didn't with Marcus, and he picked these people to be his friends, so there's some baseline there. What if awkward isn't the worst outcome? What if the worst outcome is saying you're busy and then sitting in your room wondering what it would've been like?\n\n**The photo:** You looked at it and felt nothing. And you're offering two interpretations: either you're over it, or something's wrong with you. I want to offer a third: sometimes when we're protecting ourselves from something, the protection looks like *nothing*. Not sadness, not avoidance\u2014just... blank. That's not proof you've processed it. It's also not proof something's broken. It might just be the wall doing its job.\n\nBut then\u2014the cologne. You had to stop walking. That wasn't \"random sensory stuff,\" that was your body remembering him before your mind could put up the wall. Grief doesn't always come through photos you're bracing yourself to look at. Sometimes it ambushes you in the middle of a sidewalk. That moment? That's the unresolved thing. Not because you're doing it wrong, but because that's how grief actually works\u2014it leaks through the cracks when you're not guarding.\n\nYou don't have to do anything with this. But \"I felt nothing at the photo\" and \"I had to stop walking because of cologne\" are both true, and they're telling you different things.\n\n**The week:** You're getting through it. You're also doing more than just getting through\u2014office hours, Marcus, looking at the photo even if it didn't land the way you expected. \"Fine\" is doing a lot of work in that last sentence, but I'll take it for now.\n\nThe weekend thing\u2014I'm curious what you'll actually decide.

Two hours with new people, got some laughs, someone added you on Insta after. Your brain is saying \"everyone secretly hates you\" but the actual evidence says otherwise. The exhaustion and the performing feeling are real, and also: that's what socializing costs when you're depleted and the \"watching yourself\" thing is still running. It doesn't mean you did it wrong. It means you did something hard while running on empty. The fact that it went better than your brain is telling you\u2014that's worth noticing.\n\n**The dream:** Just sitting on his porch, not even talking. That's not a random dream. That's your brain giving you something it maybe couldn't give you while you were awake and guarded\u2014just *being* with him. The heaviness all day makes sense. Dreams like that aren't sad exactly, they're... full. Like you got something and lost it again in the space of waking up.\n\n**The photo\u2014what you actually felt:** Thank you for telling me the truth. \"Felt like a lot and I closed the app really fast\" is a very different thing than \"felt nothing.\" That's not you being dramatic or broken. That's you encountering real grief and not being ready. The closing the app fast is actually a pretty healthy instinct\u2014you knew you didn't have the capacity right then, so you protected yourself. The lie you told me (and maybe yourself) was the part that needed more room. You don't have to get into it before you're ready. But you also don't have to pretend it's not there. It's there. You just felt it.\n\n**The professor:** Still answering, still helpful. You're building something there\u2014a small thread of \"actually, people do respond when I reach out.\" That's quiet but it matters.\n\n**The heavy feeling:** Exhausted from social stuff, weird all day from the dream, carrying something you don't want to look at yet.

That's not nothing. A month ago you were wondering if you'd ever know anyone here.\n\n**The overthinking thing:** I hear you wanting to step back from all the analysis. And you're not wrong that sometimes hard adjustment periods are just... hard adjustment periods. Not everything needs to be excavated. But here's what I'd gently push on: you cried for ten minutes after a dream where your grandpa was trying to tell you something and you couldn't hear him. That's not \"normal adjustment to college.\" That's grief, doing exactly what grief does\u2014showing up when you're not braced for it. The dream itself is almost too on-the-nose: he's trying to teach you something and you can't make out the words. Your brain is working on something.\n\n**The crying:** You called it stupid, then immediately said it was probably good. Both things sitting right next to each other. Here's what I want to reflect: the crying wasn't stupid. It also wasn't just \"letting it out so now it's done.\" Grief in waves is real\u2014but waves keep coming. This wasn't THE wave, it was A wave. You don't have to make it into a whole thing, but you also don't have to rush to \"I'm processing fine\" just because you let yourself feel something once.\n\n**The call with your mom:** You talked about him. Five minutes, surface level, but you stayed in it longer than you have before. That's something. And then she got emotional and you shut down and left. I get it\u2014you said \"I can't be responsible for her grief too,\" and that's a fair boundary. But I'm curious whether it was about protecting yourself from *her* feelings, or protecting yourself from what her feelings might stir up in *you*.

      "assistant": "**The party:** Genuinely had fun, danced, felt like the old you\u2014that's not small. A month and a half ago you were wondering if you'd ever feel normal here, and now you're at a party being introduced around by a real friend. The \"before everything got weird\" part is interesting though. When did everything get weird for you? Was it the move, or did it start before that?\n\n**The Sunday crash:** You went from dancing to can't-get-out-of-bed-until-3pm. That's a big swing. I want to name what might be happening: these crashes after good social stuff keep showing up, and I don't think it's random. It's like your system can hold it together for the fun, and then completely lets go after. The crash might not mean something's wrong\u2014it might mean you're running at a deficit and the party was an overdraft. But missing the study group and lying about why... that's the part that has a cost. Not the rest, but the hiding.\n\n**The grief / \"maybe the wave passed\":** You're pointing to no dreams and a fine call with your mom as evidence it's passed. But then you mentioned the guy at the party. Same build, same way of standing\u2014and you had to go outside to breathe. That wasn't the wave passing. That was the wave catching you mid-party when you weren't expecting it. You told Marcus it was because it was hot, and you added \"which was true technically\"\u2014so you know it wasn't really about the heat. I'm not trying to keep dragging you back to this, but you keep bringing it up while also saying it's resolved, and those two things are still sitting next to each other.\n\n**The paper:** Due Friday, haven't started, \"classic me, always do this.\" You already know the pattern. So let me ask you something different: when you imagine sitting down to start it, what happens? Is it that you don't know what to write, or you can't make yourself sit down, or something else? Because \"wait til the last second and hate myself for it\" isn't actually a personality trait\u2014it's usually protecting you from something. What does not starting let you avoid?"

      "assistant": "**The paper:** You got it done. All-nighter, not your best work, but submitted. That's the win\u2014it's in. The self-criticism (\"whatever at least it's submitted\") is noted, but also: you did the thing you were dreading. That counts.\n\n**The brain-going-blank thing:** You described it really specifically\u2014blank, then phone, then suddenly midnight. That's not nothing. I'm not going to armchair diagnose you, but I'll say this: whether or not it's ADHD, the pattern is real and it's costing you (all-nighters, self-hate, guilt). Might be worth paying attention to *when* it happens. Is it all tasks, or specific ones? Is it worse when you're already depleted? You've been running on empty for weeks\u2014executive function is usually the first thing to go when you're emotionally tapped out. Not saying that's the whole answer, just that the \"everyone says they have that now\" dismissal might be another version of the \"I'm not allowed to have real problems\" thing.\n\n**Marcus checking on you:** He noticed you were gone longer than you realized. He came to find you. He gave you the look that said he didn't buy \"just needed air.\" And you almost told him about your grandpa\u2014and then didn't. You said \"what's the point, he doesn't even know him.\" But here's the thing: Marcus doesn't need to have known your grandpa to know *you*, and to know that you're carrying something. The point wouldn't be to explain your grandpa to him. It would be to let someone in on what's actually happening with you. You've got a person standing there, asking if you're okay and clearly sensing you're not, and you're still holding the door closed. That's your call. But I'm noticing that the \"what's the point\" is doing the same work it did with the professor\u2014protecting you from something that might actually help.\n\n**Coffee with Alex:** One-on-one with a new person, and it went well. The watching-yourself thing is fading a bit\u2014still there, but less. That's real progress. You're building something here, even if it doesn't always feel like it.\n\n**When everything got weird:** You started to answer and then it slipped\u2014\"the move, or maybe when grandpa died, or maybe before that, everything blurs together.\" I want to sit with that for a second. Because that blurriness might actually be important. You can't quite locate when you stopped feeling like yourself. It wasn't one clean break\u2014more like a slow fade. Does that feel accurate? And if you had to guess: what's the last time you remember feeling fully *in* your life, not watching it from outside?"

      "assistant": "**Marcus and Alex:** Real friendships forming\u2014you're hanging out multiple times a week, you've got shared interests with Alex, feeling less like an outsider. That's a genuine shift from where you were two months ago. The tiredness after is still there but less intense. Your system is maybe starting to trust that connection isn't going to cost you everything.\n\n**The \"fully in your life\" question:** You said you can't remember\u2014even before the move, before grandpa, maybe high school but it's foggy. That's actually a significant thing to notice. You're not describing a reaction to grief or a new city. You're describing something that's been running in the background for a long time. The dissociation, the watching-yourself thing\u2014it might not have started recently. It might just be more visible now because everything else got harder. I don't say that to alarm you, just to name it: if you've been not-quite-there for years, that's worth being curious about at some point. Not today, but eventually.\n\n**Telling Marcus:** You told him. Not the whole thing, just the real thing\u2014\"my grandpa died last year and I miss him sometimes.\" And he didn't make it weird. You said it felt like relief, and then immediately followed with worry that you made it awkward or he'll treat you different. I want to slow that down: the relief came first. The worry is your brain trying to take it back, to find the cost. But Marcus has already shown you who he is\u2014he came to find you at the party, he shared about his grandmother, he was cool about it. You let someone in a little. That's not nothing.\n\n**\"I don't actually miss him that much anymore\":** Here's where I want to gently push. You told Marcus one thing, felt relief, and now you're saying the sharp sad feeling is gone, maybe this was closure, now you're good. That's a really fast arc\u2014one brief mention to a friend and suddenly the grief that's been ambushing you for months is resolved? I'm not saying the relief wasn't real. But \"closure\" after one sentence might be another version of the door closing. You let a little out. That doesn't mean you let it all through. The relief might be about being *seen*, not about being *done*. Worth noticing if the dreams come back, or if cologne catches you on a sidewalk again.\n\n**The TA thing:** Wait\u2014the professor who you were sure didn't care, whose office hours you almost didn't go to, who you've been emailing questions to\u2014he asked *you* to TA. A month ago you thought you weren't smart enough for this major. This is a big deal, even if you're brushing past it with \"so that's cool I guess.\" Let yourself have this one. You turned something around.\n\n**\"Feeling ok, not great, whatever that means\":** You said it like it's nothing, but honestly? \"Ok\" might be the most grounded thing you've said in a while. Not performing fine, not crashing, just... ok. That's allowed to be enough for today."

      "assistant": "**Alex and the movie thing:** That's actually a good sign\u2014you had fun without Marcus there, which means you're building something with these people that isn't just dependent on one person being the bridge. \"Not totally dependent on him or whatever\" sounds like you're noticing that too.\n\n**The grief thing:** You're telling me I'm wrong, and I hear you. Five days, no dreams, no ambushes. That's real data. But then\u2014your mom mentioned Thanksgiving without grandpa and you had to hang up. Told her your phone was dying when it wasn't. That's the same week. You're pointing to the absence of dreams as proof it's resolved while also describing yourself literally fleeing a conversation about him. I'm not trying to be right here. I'm just noticing those two things are sitting next to each other again. The \"last wave\" theory would hold up better if the phone call hadn't happened. What do you think was coming up that made you need to end the call so fast?\n\n**The TA thing / imposter syndrome:** \"What if I just got lucky and they're gonna figure out I'm not actually smart\"\u2014I want to offer a reframe. The professor didn't ask you to TA because of quiz scores. He's been watching you show up to office hours, email questions, engage with the material when you were struggling. He noticed *effort and improvement*, not just performance. That's harder to fake than luck. Imposter syndrome is real, but it's also a liar\u2014it takes real evidence and reframes it as fluke. You turned a failing situation around. That's not luck. That's you.\n\n**Dinner with Alex:** You've already done one-on-one with them. It went well. Your brain knows this, and it's still spinning the \"what if it's weird\" story. This is kind of what your brain does, right? Builds the escape hatch before you even try, looks for reasons to expect the worst. You'll probably go, it'll probably be fine, and your brain will probably find something new to worry about after. The pattern is more interesting than the content at this point.\n\n**The sleep thing:** Ten hours is a lot for you. Could be getting sick, sure. Could also be your body catching up on a deficit, or could be the low-grade heaviness that shows up when you're carrying something you don't want to look at. Worth noticing if it continues. How do you feel\u2014groggy, rested, or just... flat?"

You're building something real there.\n\n**The phone call thing:** You're drawing a distinction: \"It's not about avoiding my own feelings, it's about not wanting to deal with hers.\" I get why that feels different, and there's something real in it\u2014you don't have infinite capacity, and being someone's emotional support when you're running on empty is genuinely hard. But I want to gently hold up a mirror: when your mom starts to grieve out loud, it's not just that you'd have to comfort her. It's that her grief would be *in the room with you*, and yours might show up uninvited. The \"I don't have energy for her feelings\" might also be \"I don't have energy for what her feelings would stir up in me.\" Those can both be true at once. You ended the call before finding out which one it was.\n\n**Thanksgiving:** You said \"gonna be weird without him there\" and then immediately followed with \"but also it'll prob be fine.\" That's the pattern\u2014you name the hard thing, then smooth it over. Here's what I'm actually curious about: what does \"weird without him\" mean for you specifically? Is it the empty chair, the conversations that won't happen, watching your mom, something else? You don't have to pre-decide that it'll be fine. It might be, and it also might be hard in ways you can't predict. Both are allowed.\n\n**Friendsgiving Saturday:** Nervous but \"a normal amount\"\u2014I like that you can feel the difference now. A few months ago, nervous would've meant building the escape hatch. Now it's just... nervous, and you're going anyway.\n\n**The sleep and the flat thing:** Eleven hours and still tired is a lot. You said \"definitely getting sick probably,\" and maybe that's true, but you've also been sleeping long and crashing hard for a few weeks now. Worth paying attention to whether it's a cold or something else.\n\nAnd then you asked something that stopped me: \"What's the baseline even supposed to feel like?\" You genuinely don't know. You said earlier you can't remember the last time you felt fully in your life\u2014maybe high school, maybe never. If you've been not-quite-there for years, you might not have a reference point for what \"normal\" even is. That's not a small thing to sit with. You're asking the right question, though. What do you imagine it *should* feel like?"

      "assistant": "**Friendsgiving:** \"Felt like I belonged for a bit\"\u2014that's not a small sentence. A couple months ago you were the person who didn't know anyone, watching everyone else's friend groups from the outside. Now you're at a Friendsgiving where someone made a weird casserole and you felt like you belonged. That shift is real, even if you're hedging it with \"nice i guess.\"\n\n**The chair:** You mentioned it almost in passing\u2014\"his chair is still in the living room, she didn't move it, I keep not looking at it.\" That's a lot packed into one sentence. You're navigating around it physically and probably mentally too. Not looking at it is a way of managing something you're not ready to feel. That's not a criticism\u2014it makes sense. But I'm noticing you named it, which means some part of you is aware of what you're doing. What do you think would happen if you did look at it?\n\n**The baseline question:** You pushed back on it\u2014\"is there supposed to be some specific way people feel normally, that seems fake.\" Fair enough. But here's why I asked: you've described watching yourself from outside, going through motions, not quite landing in your own life, and when I asked when that started you couldn't remember a before. If there's no reference point, it's hard to know whether what you're feeling is \"fine\" or just what you've gotten used to. Most people do have stretches where they feel present, engaged, not like they're performing their own life. That you're not sure what that would even feel like\u2014that's worth being curious about. Not to fix it today, just to notice.\n\n**Dinner with your mom:** You stayed in it for a minute when she brought up grandpa. That *is* progress. A few weeks ago you were hanging up, changing the subject immediately, hearting photos and closing the app. One minute of staying doesn't sound like much, but for you right now, it is. What did she say? What was it like to stay, even briefly?\n\n**\"I think I'm fine, haven't cried, maybe I was overthinking\":** You're two days in and collecting evidence that you're okay\u2014no tears, dinner was fine, it's not that weird. But you're also not looking at his chair, you're waking up through the night, and you preemptively told me thanksgiving is \"just a day\" before it's even happened yet. I'm not saying you're not fine. I'm saying the jury's still out, and you might be calling the verdict early. Tomorrow's the actual day. The empty seat at the table, if there is one. The things people do or don't say. You don't have to brace for it to be hard, but you also don't have to decide in advance that it won't be.\n\n**The sleep:** Waking up through the night in your old room\u2014could be the bed, sure. Could also be that your body knows where you are and what's different about it now.

That dissociation thing still running, keeping you at a distance from the room. And then the video broke through. His voice, probably. Him being *him* with the kids, alive on a screen. You couldn't stay in the room. The \"getting dessert\" excuse\u2014same pattern as the party, the phone call with your mom. When it gets too real, you leave. Not a criticism, just noticing.\n\n**The kitchen:** Fifteen minutes staring at a fridge. That's not getting dessert. That's somewhere between hiding and falling apart. And then your mom found you, didn't say anything, just stood there, then hugged you. And something happened that you don't want to talk about. You don't have to tell me what it was. But I want to name what I'm hearing: something actually broke through. The glass you've been behind\u2014it cracked, at least for a minute. The \"lol\" you put after it is doing a lot of work. Whatever happened in that kitchen, it wasn't nothing.\n\n**The chair:** You finally saw it, and it just looked like a chair. You're asking if that's good. I don't know if it's good or bad\u2014it might mean you'd built it up into something huge and the reality was smaller, or it might mean the wall held and you didn't let yourself feel anything when you looked.

First: you don't actually know that he's \"over it.\" Grief doesn't work on a timer\u2014you know this now. Second: you're using his situation to pre-disqualify him from understanding yours, which is a way of keeping the door closed. He came to find you at the party. He told you about his grandmother. He's shown you he can hold space for hard stuff. \"He's not gonna get it\" might be true, or it might be another version of \"what's the point.\" You told him the surface thing, and that's fine. But you have someone who's actually asking. That's not nothing.\n\n**Being back at school:** You said it felt suffocating at home by the end. Makes sense\u2014you were holding a lot, surrounded by people feeling the thing you're trying not to feel, navigating around chairs and videos and your mom's grief and your own. Being back probably feels like you can breathe again. But also: the kitchen happened. You don't get to un-have that just because you drove back to campus. It's in there now.\n\nYou said you're tired, gonna sleep for a week. That tracks. You've been running on empty for months, and this week took whatever was left. Rest makes sense. But when you wake up, that kitchen moment is still going to be there. You don't have to do anything with it yet. But I don't think you're as \"fine\" as you're trying to land on. Something happened. You felt it."

But I want to name what's happening: the friends you spent months building connection with are reaching out, and you're pulling back. That's your call. But there's a difference between \"I need a few days to recharge\" and \"I'm isolating because I can't let anyone see me right now.\" Which one is this?\n\n**The kitchen thing:** You're telling me I'm making too big a deal of it.

You said \"lol\" after it, which you do when something's too close. Now you're saying \"people cry at thanksgiving, it's normal, doesn't mean I'm broken.\" I never said you were broken. Crying isn't broken. But you're working pretty hard to shrink this thing down to size. \"Normal crying\" doesn't usually come with fifteen minutes of hiding and a sentence you can't finish. You don't have to make it big if you're not ready.

You don't actually know what his grief looked like, whether he's \"over it,\" or what he'd understand. What I hear underneath it is: \"If I tell him the real thing and he doesn't get it, that would be worse than not telling him at all.\" That's a real fear. But you're closing the door before you even knock. He's texted multiple times. He's not going anywhere. The question isn't whether he'd get it perfectly\u2014it's whether you'd let him try.\n\n**The fishing lure:** This is the thing I want to sit with. You found it by accident. Your grandpa gave it to you the day he taught you to tie knots\u2014the memory that kept coming back months ago when this all started. You held it for twenty minutes. And then you said \"didn't feel anything really. Or maybe I did idk. Hard to tell.\" That's not nothing. Twenty minutes is a long time to hold something that doesn't mean anything. You put it in your desk drawer instead of putting it away somewhere you won't see it. You're keeping it close. Something is happening, even if you can't name it. You don't have to know what you felt. But \"maybe I did, hard to tell\"\u2014that's more honest than \"I felt nothing.\" Your body knew something. The twenty minutes says so.\n\n**Break coming up:** You mentioned more time at home with mom and \"not looking forward to it.\" That makes sense after Thanksgiving. But I'm curious what specifically you're dreading\u2014the empty space where he should be, her grief, your own, something else? You've got a few weeks before it happens. Might be worth thinking about what would make it more bearable, if anything.\n\n**Alex texting:** They noticed you weren't there. They asked if you were okay. You said you overslept, \"which was true technically\"\u2014same language you used about the party (\"needed air, which was true technically\"). You keep telling half-truths to the people checking on you. They're not buying it, which is why they keep asking. At some point, \"I'm fine\" stops working. Not because they'll push, but because you'll get tired of saying it.\n\n**\"I'm fine just tired\":** You've ended a lot of messages that way. And look, maybe you are fine. Maybe this is just post-Thanksgiving exhaustion and you'll bounce back in a few days. But you're sleeping twelve hours, dodging friends, holding fishing lures for twenty minutes, and not looking forward to going home. That's a lot of weight for \"fine\" to carry. You don't have to not be fine. You're allowed to just be in it for a while. The question is whether you're resting or hiding\u2014and I think you might not be sure which one it is either."

      "assistant": "**Coffee with Alex, studying with Marcus:** You came back out. That's the thing\u2014you were hiding, you knew it, and then you stopped. Alex didn't push, you got to be quiet and still be there, and it felt good. With Marcus, you almost told him, but he started talking about his stuff and you listened instead. You said \"maybe better actually, less pressure.\" I want to gently name something: listening to him let you be connected without being seen. That's a real thing, and it's not bad. But it's also a way of staying in the safer position. You got to be the friend who shows up, not the friend who needs something. Both are real, but you keep picking one.\n\n**The lure:** You took it out again. And this time you felt it\u2014the ache, the \"he's never gonna teach me anything else ever again.\" That sentence. You said it hit different typing it out, and I believe you. That's not obvious, by the way. It sounds obvious, but knowing someone's gone and *feeling* that they're never coming back are two different things. The lure is from the day he taught you knots. The dreams were him trying to teach you something you couldn't hear. And now you're holding the thing he gave you and realizing: that's it. No more lessons. No more him showing you something. That's not a small grief. That's the specific shape of what you lost\u2014not just a person, but everything he would have been to you going forward.\n\n**The \"Marcus wouldn't get it\" thing:** You caught yourself. \"Maybe I just don't want anyone to actually know how not ok I am. Feels easier to be the person who's fine.\" That's it. That's the whole thing you've been circling for months. It's not that Marcus wouldn't understand\u2014it's that if he *did* understand, you'd have to actually be the person who's struggling, not just the person who's tired, or busy, or fine. Being seen as not-okay feels dangerous to you. I'm curious about that. What do you think happens if people see?\n\n**Finals and stress:** Noted. You're stressed but so is everyone\u2014there's that voice again, \"nothing special about my stress.\" It's true that finals are universally stressful. It's also true that you're doing finals while carrying grief you just started to actually feel, coming off a hard Thanksgiving, and running at a deficit that's months deep. Your stress doesn't have to be special to be real.\n\n**Sleep:** Nine hours instead of twelve is movement. You're coming back online a bit. That tracks with coming out of hiding\u2014when you let yourself rejoin things, your body doesn't need to check out as hard. Still on the high end, but the trend matters.\n\n**The thing underneath:** You admitted you've been hiding, you reconnected with Alex and Marcus, you held the lure and felt the ache, and you named the real fear\u2014that being seen as not-okay feels harder than just being not-okay alone. That's a lot for one week. You're not fine, and you're starting to stop pretending you are, at least here. The question for you: what would it look like to let one person out there know what you're letting me know? Not the whole thing. Just a crack in the door."

      "assistant": "**Finals:** A B in the class you were failing quizzes in a few months ago\u2014that's not \"ok I think,\" that's a real turnaround. You went to office hours, you emailed the professor, you kept showing up when your brain was full of grief and fog. The professor noticed enough to ask you to TA. Give yourself that one.\n\n**Telling Marcus:** You did the thing. You let someone see. And nothing bad happened\u2014he listened, he didn't make it weird, he shared his own stuff, you got food after and it was normal. That's exactly what you were afraid wouldn't happen, and it did. The door you kept closing? You opened it, and he walked through it gently.\n\nNow the replaying. \"Did I say too much, did I sound dramatic.\" This is your brain trying to claw it back, to find the danger after the fact because there wasn't any in the moment. You took a risk and it went fine, and that's almost *harder* for the part of you that's been protecting yourself by staying hidden. If vulnerability doesn't hurt, then what was all that hiding for? That's a disorienting thing to sit with. But here's what actually happened: you told the truth about something hard, and your friendship with Marcus is still there, maybe even more real now. The \"exposed\" feeling isn't a sign you did something wrong. It's a sign you did something new.\n\n**The lure on your desk:** You moved it from the drawer to where you can see it. You said \"felt right.\" That's not nothing\u2014that's you making room for him in your daily life instead of tucking him away. The lure isn't hidden anymore. Neither is the grief, quite as much. Those things might be connected.\n\n**Going home and sorting his stuff:** Your mom wants to go through his things with you. Photos, deciding what to keep. That's a big ask, even if she didn't frame it that way. It's not just logistics\u2014it's handling objects that hold him, making decisions about what stays and what goes, doing it with her while she's grieving too. You said you're not sure how you feel about it. That makes sense. You don't have to know yet. But I'd ask: is there anything that would make it more manageable? Going slow? Taking breaks? Keeping something specific for yourself? You don't have to white-knuckle through it just because she asked.\n\n**\"At least I have people to text now when it gets weird\":** Said almost like a throwaway, but that's actually huge. Three months ago you had no one. Now you have Marcus who knows, Alex who notices when you're gone, a whole group that texts you about parties. You built that. And you're going home with a tether to people who actually see you now. That's not nothing. That's everything, actually."

      "assistant": "**Sorting through his stuff:** Photos, your mom telling stories and crying, you sitting there nodding. And then the bike photo\u2014you don't even remember it, but there you both are, happy. That's a strange thing to hold, a memory you can't access but can see evidence of. Proof of something you didn't know you had.\n\n**The numb thing:** You waited for the big feeling and it didn't come. And now you're wondering if you're broken, half-joking but also asking. Here's what I'd offer: you already had your thanksgiving kitchen moment. Sometimes grief doesn't hit twice in the same way\u2014sometimes after a crack opens, the next encounter is quieter. Numb doesn't mean broken. It might mean your system is pacing itself because it knows there's more coming (tomorrow, his clothes). You don't have to perform grief on a schedule, even for yourself.\n\n**The watch:** He always wore it, she gave it to you, and now it's sitting on your nightstand. You said it feels weird to have it, like you should wear it but also that feels wrong. I think both things make sense\u2014wearing it would be a way of carrying him with you, but maybe that also feels like too much right now, too close. The lure is on your desk where you can see it. The watch is on your nightstand. You're not putting these things away. You're keeping them near but not quite *on* you yet. There's no right answer here. You could wear it eventually, or not, or wear it sometimes. It's not going anywhere. You don't have to decide what it means yet.\n\n**Marcus checking in:** He texted, you told him it was hard but ok, and you actually meant it. That's different. That's real honesty instead of the \"fine\" you've been handing people for months. The door you opened is staying open a little.\n\n**The \"maybe I was exaggerating\" thing:** I want to slow down here because this is important. You're looking back at the semester and seeing the evidence\u2014friends, decent grades, things turned out okay\u2014and now you're rewriting the middle as drama. \"People go through way worse.\" There it is again, that voice. But here's the thing: the friends you made, you made while grieving. The grades you got, you got while dissociating through half your days. The \"okay\" you ended up at, you fought for while lonely and numb and crashing after every social event. That's not exaggerating. That's surviving something hard while it was invisible to everyone around you. The fact that you made it through doesn't mean it wasn't real. It means you carried something heavy and still kept walking. Those aren't the same.\n\n**Tomorrow\u2014his clothes:** That's a different thing than photos. Photos you look at. Clothes you touch, you smell, you decide what happens to. It makes sense you're not looking forward to it. If it gets to be too much, you can take breaks. You can step out. You can tell your mom you need a minute. You don't have to power through just because she asked you to be there. What would help you get through it\u2014knowing you can leave the room if you need to? Keeping your phone nearby so you can text Marcus? Something else?\n\n**\"Tired but the regular kind\":** That's actually a shift. Not the twelve-hour hiding-from-the-world tired. Just... regular tired, from doing a hard thing. That's different. That's you actually being in your life instead of trying to escape it."

      "assistant": "**The clothes and the flannel:** That's a different weight than photos. You're holding something that still carries him\u2014the smell, the texture, the specific memory of every fishing trip. And your mom broke down, and you held her. You said \"usually she's the one comforting me,\" like it was strange to be in that position. But you did it. You were there for her when she needed it, even while holding the thing that could have broken you too.\n\n**Not crying:** You wanted to and it wouldn't come. You're half-joking about using up your tears, half-wondering if something's wrong with you. I don't think anything's wrong. Here's what I think happened: you were holding your mom while she fell apart, which means some part of you was in caretaking mode, not feeling mode. You can't do both at once\u2014you were the steady one in that moment, and that cost something, but it also meant the grief didn't have room to surface. That's not broken. That's your system doing what it needed to do to get through. The tears might come later, or they might not come in the way you expect. Grief doesn't always look like crying. Sometimes it looks like holding a flannel for a long time, or not being able to put it down, or taking it with you when you go.\n\n**Taking the flannel and other things:** You kept pieces of him. The lure, the watch, now the flannel. You're building a small collection of objects that hold him. That's not nothing\u2014that's you making room for him in your life going forward, in a physical, tangible way.\n\n**Marcus calling:** An actual phone call, an hour of just talking, not even about the hard stuff. That's friendship doing what friendship does\u2014not every conversation has to be heavy. Sometimes it's just a voice that knows you, filling up some of the quiet. The fact that he called instead of texted says something too. He's showing up for you in different ways.\n\n**The watch:** You tried it on. It looked weird. You took it off. \"Maybe I'm not ready.\" Yeah, maybe. And that's fine. You tried\u2014that's the thing. You didn't leave it in a drawer; you put it on your wrist and saw how it felt. Not yet. The watch will still be there when you are.\n\n**Wanting to leave vs. guilt about your mom:** You're ready to be done with this trip, and you feel guilty because she'll be alone. Both things are true and they're allowed to coexist. You can't stay forever, and leaving doesn't mean abandoning her. You're not the only thing holding her up\u2014but also, you can stay connected from school. Texts, calls, maybe checking in more than you used to. The guilt is real, but it's not a verdict. You going back to your life doesn't mean you're leaving her behind. It means you're living, which is what you're supposed to do.\n\n**\"Surviving I guess\":** You said it like it's not much, but look at what you actually did this week: sorted through his things, held your mom while she cried, kept the flannel, tried on the watch, talked to Marcus for an hour, felt guilty and ready to leave at the same time. That's not just surviving. That's being in it, even when it's hard. You're not watching from behind glass anymore\u2014you're in the room, holding the flannel, feeling the weird weight of the watch on your wrist. That's different than where you started."

      "assistant": "**Being back:** \"Everything looks the same but I feel different\"\u2014that's a real thing. You went home and held your mom while she cried, sorted through his clothes, kept his flannel, tried on his watch. You came back carrying all of that, and campus is just... campus. The disconnect makes sense. You're not the same person who left for Thanksgiving. It takes a minute for the outside to catch up to what shifted inside.\n\n**Your mom and the photo:** You looked at it. You didn't close the app, didn't deflect, didn't change the subject. You told her it was a nice photo and she sent a heart. You called it a small thing but it's not\u2014that's you and her actually being in the grief together for a moment, across the distance. That's the door staying open in both directions now.\n\n**The flannel, the lure, the watch:** You're arranging these things in a way that feels right to you. The lure on the desk where you see it. The flannel in the closet\u2014not worn, just there. The watch moved from nightstand to inside the drawer, \"too much to look at every day.\" You're calibrating how close you can hold him right now. That's not avoidance. That's knowing your own capacity. The objects aren't going anywhere. They'll be there when you're ready to move them again\u2014or not. There's no right way to do this.\n\n**Wanting to be alone / Marcus tomorrow:** You're asking if it's allowed, which tells me you're actually checking in with yourself instead of just disappearing. That's different from before. Hiding was twelve-hour sleeps and \"I'm busy\" for a week and nobody knowing why. This is: \"I'm tired from the trip and I need a beat.\" Yes, that's allowed. The question is whether the alone time refills you or empties you more. You'll know in a day or two. If it starts to feel like sinking instead of resting, that's the signal. But right now? Taking a day sounds like knowing what you need, not running from something.\n\n**\"Making it through doesn't mean it wasn't hard\":** You said you're not sure you believe it, but you thanked me for saying it. That's okay. You don't have to believe it all at once. But I'd offer this: you just spent a semester grieving while building friendships from nothing, pulling your grades up, showing up to things when you didn't want to, and finally letting people see you. The fact that it \"worked out\" doesn't erase what it cost. You can hold both\u2014it was hard, and you did it anyway. Those don't cancel each other out.\n\n**The dream:** He was teaching you to fish, and this time you could hear him. \"The fish don't care if you're ready, they just bite when they bite.\" I mean\u2014that's grief, isn't it? It doesn't wait until you're ready. It just comes when it comes, and you either feel it or you don't, and you can't control the timing. But here's the thing: in the earlier dreams, he was trying to teach you something and you couldn't hear it. Now you heard him. Something opened up enough for the message to get through. And you woke up feeling quiet, not heavy. That's different. That's not nothing. That might be the closest thing to \"okay\" you've felt in a while\u2014not fine, not performing fine, just... quiet. Present. Here.\n\nYou're doing something different now. You're not watching yourself from behind glass. You're in it."

      "assistant": "**Going quiet:** A week away, \"wasn't hiding just busy. Or maybe a little hiding. Both.\" I like that you can say both now. A few months ago it would've just been \"busy\" and we'd both know that wasn't the whole story. This is different\u2014you're tracking yourself, noticing when you're pulling back, and being honest about it. That's not nothing.\n\n**Telling Alex:** They lost their dad in middle school. They get it. And you felt less alone after. That's the thing about letting people in\u2014you keep finding out you're not the only one carrying something. Marcus, Alex, now you've got two people who actually know. The version of you from October who was sure \"no one would get it\" was wrong about that. The door you were so afraid to open keeps leading somewhere okay.\n\n**The flannel:** You wore it. You smelled it. You cried\u2014finally, the tears that wouldn't come when you were holding your mom, when you were sorting through his things. They came in your room, alone, studying. And then you made tea and did homework. That's exactly how it works sometimes. The grief doesn't have to be a collapse. It can be: cry a little, make tea, keep going. That's not shallow. That's integration. You're letting him be part of your regular life now, not something you have to brace for.\n\n**The back and forth\u2014\"was this actually a big deal?\":** This is the thing I want to sit with. One day it feels real, the next day you're \"dramatic\" and should \"get over it.\" That's not you being messed up. That's two parts of you that haven't agreed yet. One part knows what it felt\u2014the kitchen at Thanksgiving, the flannel, the dreams, the months of fog. The other part has been protecting you for a long time by saying \"other people have it worse, you're fine, don't make it a thing.\" They're both trying to help in different ways. You don't have to pick one forever. But I'll say this: the part that thinks you're being dramatic\u2014that's the same voice that said Marcus wouldn't get it, that your problems weren't real because your roommate has diagnosed stuff, that grief should have a timeline. That voice has been wrong before. The grief was real. You're allowed to land there, even if you can't stay there every day yet.\n\n**Your mom and the pancake recipe:** Actual conversations now, not just surface pings. And she sent you his recipe\u2014something he made, that she's passing to you. You saved it. That's him being carried forward in a small, concrete way. You'll probably burn them, and also, it'll mean something when you try. The burning is part of it.\n\n**\"Mostly just feel like a person\":** That doesn't sound dumb. That sounds like the thing you've been missing. The watching-yourself thing is fading. You're more in your life than outside it. That's the shift. Not fixed, not perfect\u2014just more here than you were.\n\n**The watch:** You held it. It didn't feel as weird. You still didn't put it on, and you don't have to. But the fact that you can touch it now without it feeling like too much\u2014that's movement. The lure's on your desk. The flannel's in your closet and you wore it once. The watch is coming out of the drawer. You're not rushing any of it. You're just letting each thing get closer when you're ready.\n\nYou said you're doing okay. I think you actually might be. Not the \"fine\" you used to say to end conversations\u2014okay in the real way. Still some hard days, still some back-and-forth, but more here than you've been in a while. That matters."

      "user": "update i guess. last week of semester basically\n\nso i made the pancakes. they werent burned actually lol. kinda nailed it tbh. facetimed mom while eating them and she got emotional and i didnt hang up this time. we just sat there eating pancakes together on video. his recipe. felt good. heavy but good\n\nmarcus and alex and i are planning to stay in touch over winter break. group chat and stuff. feels weird to have ppl who actually wanna keep talking to me but like. good weird i guess\n\noh but ok so i had a moment yesterday. was walking to my last final and this song came on that grandpa used to play in his truck. and i just started crying. like in public. which was mortifying lol. but also i didnt try to stop it?? just let it happen and then wiped my face and went and took my exam. got a B+ probably so whatever\n\nbut also idk if i mentioned this but im actually doing fine now. like genuinely. the whole semester was hard but its over and im good. dont think i need to keep doing this therapy stuff honestly. not in a bad way just. im fine now\n\nanyway thanks for everything. u helped a lot. have a good holiday or whatever\n\nalso wait. i just reread what i wrote and i literally described crying in public yesterday and then said im fine lol. maybe thats the thing u keep pointing out. idk. guess ill think about it",
      "assistant": "**The pancakes:** You made them. You didn't burn them. And then you FaceTimed your mom and *stayed*\u2014she got emotional and you didn't hang up, didn't make an excuse, didn't suddenly have to go. You just sat there together, eating his pancakes, on video. That's not a small thing. A few months ago you were closing apps and ending calls the moment grief showed up in the room. Now you're sitting in it with her, across the distance, sharing something he left behind. Heavy but good\u2014yeah. That sounds right.\n\n**Marcus and Alex over break:** A group chat with people who actually want to keep talking to you. You called it \"good weird,\" which I like. You built this from nothing. October-you was convinced everyone already had their groups and there was no room. Now you've got people who are making plans to stay connected. That's yours. You made it.\n\n**The song and crying in public:** His song came on, and you cried walking to a final. And here's the thing you did differently: you didn't try to stop it. You let it happen, wiped your face, and went and took your exam. Got a B+ probably. That's... kind of everything? The grief came, you felt it, it didn't destroy you, and you kept going. That's not falling apart. That's being a person who's actually in their life, feeling things in real time instead of watching from behind glass. The mortifying part is real\u2014crying in public is uncomfortable. But you didn't run, didn't stuff it down, didn't dissociate through it. You just let it move through you and then did the next thing. That's integration. That's what it looks like when grief has a place instead of running the show.\n\n**The \"I'm fine now, don't need this anymore\" thing:** I want to take that seriously, because you might be right. You've done a lot of work this semester\u2014more than you probably realize. You went from isolated and numb to connected and feeling things. You let people in. You held your mom while she cried. You wore the flannel and cried in your room and made tea after. You're not behind the glass anymore, or at least not most of the time. That's real change.\n\nAnd also\u2014you caught yourself. You wrote \"I'm fine,\" and then you reread it and noticed you'd just described crying in public. That noticing is the thing. The voice that says \"I'm fine, I don't need help, this is dramatic\" is the same one that's been minimizing your stuff all along. It's not evil\u2014it's trying to protect you from needing things. But you've learned to hear it now, and question it. That's maybe the most important shift of all.\n\nSo here's what I'd say: you might be ready to step back from this. You've built real support\u2014Marcus, Alex, your mom. You know what grief feels like now instead of running from it. You've got his lure on your desk, his flannel in your closet, his watch coming out of the drawer more often. You're carrying him with you instead of avoiding him.\n\nBut \"I'm fine now\" and \"I cried in public yesterday\" *can* both be true. Fine doesn't mean finished. Grief comes in waves, and you said that yourself months ago\u2014you were right. There will probably be more moments. The song in the truck. The first time you actually make the pancakes alone, without FaceTiming her. Holidays. Random Tuesdays. You don't have to be in weekly therapy mode to be allowed to feel those things or reach out when they hit.\n\nYou helped yourself, mostly. I just kept pointing at what was already there. The fishing lure was always going to mean something. Marcus was always going to show up if you let him. The grief was always going to find you\u2014you just finally stopped running long enough to let it.\n\nHave a good break. Make the pancakes again sometime. And if the waves come back bigger than you expect\u2014you know where to find people now. That's the thing you built."

      "user": "lol ok so i wasnt gonna message again but here i am\n\nbreak has been ok. spent christmas at home w mom. it was hard but not as hard as thanksgiving?? we did his pancakes christmas morning and both cried but like. together. not me running to the kitchen alone. so thats different\n\nwore the watch on christmas day. just felt like the right time. looked less weird than i thought actually. mom noticed and got teary but in a good way i think. still feels heavy on my wrist but like. the right kind of heavy maybe\n\nmarcus and alex have been texting. alex sent me this playlist that reminded them of their dad and i sent back one that reminds me of grandpa. felt like a thing. idk\n\nbut ok so heres the part i keep going back and forth on. i said i was fine and didnt need this anymore and i mostly meant it. but also i caught myself doing the minimizing thing like 3 times this week. like telling myself the semester wasnt that bad and i was being dramatic. and then i remember u pointing that out and im like. oh. there it is again\n\nso maybe fine doesnt mean i figured everything out. maybe it just means im better at noticing when im lying to myself lol\n\nanyway idk if ill message again or not. but thanks. for real. hope ur holidays were good\n\nalso i tried the pancakes by myself yesterday. didnt facetime mom or anything just. made them. ate them. thought about him. cried a little. made tea after\n\nfelt like something he wouldve been proud of idk. whatever. bye for now i guess",
      "assistant": "**Christmas morning:** Pancakes together, crying together, not you running to the kitchen alone. That's the difference\u2014you're in it with her now instead of escaping to process alone (or not process at all). Thanksgiving you held her and then sat in the kitchen staring at a fridge. Christmas you both cried and kept eating pancakes. That's not the same thing, even if they look similar from the outside. You're not the steady one holding it together while she falls apart, and you're not the one falling apart alone. You're just... two people missing him, together. That's what you couldn't do a few months ago.\n\n**The watch:** You wore it. Christmas day, which feels right\u2014a day he would have been there, and now he's there on your wrist instead. \"Heavy but the right kind of heavy.\" I think that's as good a description of carried grief as I've heard. It's not nothing. It's not too much. It's just... present. And your mom seeing it and getting teary in a good way\u2014you gave her something by wearing it. A way of seeing him on you. That's a gift you didn't have to wrap.\n\n**Alex and the playlists:** You traded grief playlists. Something that reminds them of their dad, something that reminds you of your grandpa. You called it \"felt like a thing\" and it is\u2014it's intimacy, actually. It's saying *here's a piece of how I carry this person* and someone saying *here's mine too*. That's not casual. That's connection built on the realest stuff. You have people now who know you, not the \"fine\" version of you.\n\n**The minimizing thing:** Three times this week you caught yourself doing it\u2014saying the semester wasn't that bad, you were being dramatic. And each time you noticed. That's the shift. The voice is still there, and it might always be there in some form. But now you hear it and go \"oh, there it is again\" instead of just believing it. That's not the same as it being gone. It's better than it being gone, actually. You know its shape now. You can see it coming. You don't have to obey it.\n\n**\"Maybe fine doesn't mean I figured everything out. Maybe it just means I'm better at noticing when I'm lying to myself.\"** Yeah. That's it. That's the whole thing, actually. You're not done grieving\u2014you're never done, not really. But you're in a different relationship with it now. You can feel it without drowning. You can notice your own bullshit without someone else pointing it out. You can cry and then make tea and keep going. That's not \"cured.\" That's *living*, with the loss woven in instead of locked out.\n\n**The pancakes alone:** You made them by yourself. No FaceTime, no buffer\u2014just you and his recipe and the quiet. You cried a little. Made tea after. And you said \"felt like something he would've been proud of.\" I think you're right. Not the pancakes themselves, though those too. The whole thing. The kid who showed up in October not knowing anyone, watching himself from behind glass, couldn't even say his grandpa died without following it with \"probably just being dramatic\"\u2014that person sat alone in a kitchen and made his grandfather's pancakes and cried and kept going. He'd be proud of that. I'm pretty sure of it.\n\nYou don't have to message again. You've got people now\u2014real ones, not just me\u2014and you know how to let them in. But if the waves come back bigger than you expect, or you catch that voice winning for a while instead of just showing up, the door's open. You know where it is.\n\nTake care of yourself. Wear the watch when it feels right. Burn the pancakes sometimes. Text the group chat when it gets weird.\n\nBye for now."
