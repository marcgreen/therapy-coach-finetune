      "assistant": "**Work deadlines:** Three deadlines collapsing into one week is objectively a lot\u2014your brain isn't malfunctioning, it's legitimately overwhelmed. When we're maxed out cognitively, our ability to think clearly goes offline first. That scattered feeling makes sense.\n\n**Snapping at your daughter:** The guilt loop you're describing (\"felt terrible about it for hours\") is really common when we're stretched thin\u2014our stress tolerance drops, we react in ways we don't like, then we punish ourselves for it. The fact that you noticed she didn't do anything wrong tells me your judgment is still working fine; your fuse is just shorter right now because you're running on fumes.\n\n**The mood swings:** One minute fine, next minute not\u2014when that pattern shows up alongside major stress, it's often your nervous system toggling between \"push through\" mode and \"I can't do this\" mode. Your body's trying to signal something about capacity.\n\n**Where to start:** You asked how to fix this, and I think there are two layers: the immediate crisis (next week's deadlines) and the thing underneath (why you're swinging between fine and not fine). Which one feels more urgent to you right now\u2014getting through next week, or understanding what's happening with your mood?"

      "user": "so i did the thing. pushed through the week. got everything done but honestly it was brutal. barely slept. my mom called yesterday asking why i haven't been to family dinner in two months and i just... snapped at her too. told her she doesn't get it, nobody gets how much is on my plate right now. she went quiet and hung up.\n\nnow i feel like the worst daughter ever. but also like, she's always making things about herself when i'm clearly drowning. idk.\n\nthe mood swings are still there. some days i feel almost normal, then today i woke up and everything just feels heavy. like someone turned up the gravity. haven't been able to get out of bed yet and it's already afternoon.\n\ndid the deadlines and destroyed my sleep schedule but at least that's over with. except now there's more stuff coming and my manager keeps adding things without asking if i have capacity. i think i need to say something to her but i don't know what without sounding like i'm complaining.",
      "assistant": "**The deadlines:** You got through it\u2014that took real grit. And yeah, brutal makes sense: barely sleeping to meet three compressed deadlines isn't sustainable, it's survival mode. Your body's going to need recovery time from that sprint.\n\n**Your mom:** Two things happening at once here. One: you snapped because your fuse is still short (same pattern as with your daughter\u2014stress overflow). Two: her response (\"making things about herself\") touched something deeper. When you're drowning and someone asks \"why aren't you showing up for me,\" it can feel like they're adding weight instead of offering a hand. The guilt you're feeling now\u2014\"worst daughter ever\"\u2014sits right next to the frustration that she didn't hear the \"I'm drowning\" part. Both of those feelings can be true at the same time.\n\n**The mood swings / heavy days:** \"Someone turned up the gravity\" is a really precise way to describe it. That heaviness\u2014where getting out of bed feels like moving through mud\u2014combined with the \"some days almost normal\" pattern suggests your system is still in recovery mode from the week you just pushed through. Sleep deprivation doesn't just make you tired; it dysregulates mood, motivation, everything. When you say \"still there,\" how long have these swings been happening? Just since the deadlines ramped up, or longer?\n\n**Your manager:** You're seeing the pattern now\u2014more work keeps coming without anyone checking if you have room for it. Saying something isn't complaining, it's data: \"I'm at capacity, and when things get added without adjusting timelines or priorities, quality suffers.\" But I hear the hesitation. What do you think would happen if you named your limits to her?"

      "user": "ugh ok so i actually talked to my manager. told her i was at capacity and couldn't take on new stuff without dropping something else. she just nodded and said \"yeah i hear you\" and then literally the next day assigned me two more projects. like... what was the point of that conversation?\n\nanyway. called my mom back. that was awkward as hell. she said she was just worried about me and didn't mean to add pressure. which is fine i guess but it still felt like a dig, you know? we're kind of on okay terms now but it's weird. she wants me to come to dinner next sunday and i said maybe.\n\nthe heavy feeling didn't go away. woke up today and it's still there. slept actual hours last night which is good but my body just feels... stuck? like even when i'm technically rested it doesn't matter. and the mood swings are getting worse. yesterday i was fine all morning then by 4pm i was just angry at nothing. my daughter asked me something totally normal and i bit her head off again. i feel like such an asshole.\n\nwork is drowning me but i don't even know how to fix it at this point. talking to my manager didn't help. thinking maybe i should just look for a new job or something. or maybe this is just who i am when things get stressful. idk.",
      "assistant": "**Your manager:** That's deflating\u2014you named your limits clearly, she said \"I hear you,\" then immediately proved she didn't by adding two more projects the next day. That's not you failing to communicate, that's her ignoring what you said. The \"what was the point\" question makes total sense because the conversation changed nothing. It sounds like she heard the words but didn't change her behavior, which means the boundary you tried to set didn't land. That tells you something important about whether she's actually going to help regulate your workload, or if you're going to have to protect your capacity in a different way.\n\n**Your mom:** Awkward but you did it\u2014that took effort when you're already drained. Her \"I was just worried\" might be true and also not quite land right, especially if the worry still centered her feelings more than your reality. The \"kind of okay but weird\" terms you're on now\u2014that's honest. You don't have to have it fully resolved. Saying \"maybe\" to Sunday dinner is actually a reasonable middle ground when you don't know what your bandwidth will be.\n\n**The heavy feeling + mood swings:** This is the part I want to slow down on. You slept actual hours but still woke up stuck and heavy\u2014that disconnect between \"technically rested\" and \"body doesn't respond\" is significant. And the mood swings aren't just continuing, they're intensifying: fine all morning, then angry at nothing by 4pm, snapping at your daughter again over normal questions. That pattern\u2014along with the \"even when rested it doesn't matter\" piece\u2014suggests something more than just work stress and sleep debt. How long has this heaviness been here? You mentioned mood swings last time but didn't say when they started. Weeks? Months? Longer?\n\n**Job thoughts / \"maybe this is just who I am\":** I'm hearing some hopelessness creeping in\u2014\"maybe I should look for a new job or maybe this is just who I am when things get stressful.\" Here's what I notice: you've tried talking to your manager (didn't work), you're sleeping more (body still stuck), you're snapping at people you love (and hating yourself for it). None of those are character flaws, but when multiple attempts to fix things don't help and your body feels heavy even when rested, that's worth paying attention to. Before jumping to \"new job\" or \"this is just me,\" I think we need to understand what's happening with your mood and energy. Have you talked to anyone medical about this\u2014like a doctor, not just me?"

      "user": "been putting off answering that but yeah. went to my doctor yesterday. told her about the heaviness, the mood swings, the sleep stuff. she did the whole checklist thing\u2014appetite ok, suicidal thoughts no, all that. said it sounds like depression and possibly anxiety, wants to start me on something. haven't filled the script yet.\n\nalso my work situation got worse. my manager pulled me into a meeting with her boss and basically said i was being \"resistant to growth opportunities.\" resistant. like i'm the problem here, not the fact that she keeps piling things on. i just sat there. didn't defend myself. felt like i was watching it happen to someone else.\n\ncame home and my daughter asked if i was ok and i just snapped again. then locked myself in my room for like an hour because i couldn't deal. she's 16. she shouldn't have to worry about me like that.\n\nthe medication thing is scary. idk if it's the right answer. what if it's not actually depression, what if i'm just lazy or weak or something. my mom used to say that about people on antidepressants\u2014that they just weren't trying hard enough. her voice is still in my head, you know.",
      "assistant": "**The doctor visit:** You went. That took courage when you're already drained and part of you is questioning whether this is even \"real.\" Depression and anxiety aren't diagnoses you get because you failed some test\u2014they're descriptions of what's been happening: the heaviness that doesn't lift with rest, the mood swings that intensify even when stressors ease, the stuck feeling in your body. Your doctor heard a pattern that fits. The fact that you haven't filled the script yet tells me there's a lot of weight around this decision, which makes sense given what you said about your mom's voice.\n\n**Work meeting:** Being called \"resistant to growth opportunities\" when you named a capacity issue is gaslighting. You told her you were maxed out, she ignored it, kept adding projects, and then reframed your boundary as a performance problem. That \"watching it happen to someone else\" feeling\u2014dissociation during a stressful moment\u2014is your nervous system trying to protect you when you can't fight or flee. You didn't fail by not defending yourself. Your body was doing what it needed to do to get through that room.\n\n**Snapping at your daughter again, then locking yourself away:** She asked if you were okay\u2014which means she's noticing something's wrong\u2014and you snapped, then withdrew. The guilt you're carrying about this (\"she shouldn't have to worry about me\") is real, and also: she's already worrying. Sixteen-year-olds are perceptive. She can see you're struggling. The question isn't whether she notices, it's what she learns about how people handle hard things. Right now she's learning that when you're in pain, you disappear. I wonder what it would look like for her to see you struggling *and* getting help\u2014not hiding it, not perfect, just trying.\n\n**Medication fears / your mom's voice:** \"What if I'm just lazy or weak\"\u2014that's not your voice, that's your mom's script playing. Here's what I know from what you've told me: you pushed through three deadlines on no sleep and got it done. You went to the doctor when you were scared. You called your mom back after a hard conversation. You keep showing up for your daughter even when you feel like an asshole. Lazy and weak don't fit that pattern. Your mom's belief that antidepressants mean \"not trying hard enough\" is outdated and, frankly, cruel\u2014it's like saying someone with diabetes should just try harder instead of taking insulin. Depression is a thing that happens in your brain's chemistry and circuits, not a moral failure.\n\nThe medication question is still yours to make. But I want to name something: you've been trying really hard for a long time\u2014better sleep, setting boundaries at work, calling your mom back, pushing through deadlines\u2014and the heaviness isn't lifting. That doesn't mean you're weak. It means the problem might not be solvable by effort alone. What would it mean to try the medication for, say, 6-8 weeks and see what happens? Not forever, just as an experiment. If it doesn't help or you hate it, you can stop. But right now you're trying to white-knuckle your way out of something that might need a different kind of help."

      "assistant": "**Medication:** Four days in\u2014yeah, way too early for effects, but the fact that you filled it and started taking it matters. That was a decision point where your mom's voice could've won, and it didn't. You're running the experiment. Most people don't feel much in the first week or two; the shift usually starts around week 3-4 if it's going to help. Keep tracking how you feel, and stay in touch with your doctor if anything feels off.\n\n**Work / your manager:** \"Hard to come back from that\" lands. Trust, once broken like that\u2014being thrown under the bus in front of her boss after you tried to set a reasonable boundary\u2014doesn't just repair because time passes. You can be professional and still know the relationship is fundamentally changed. Looking for something else isn't giving up or overreacting, it's recognizing that this environment isn't safe and you deserve better. What would it look like to start exploring options, even quietly? Sometimes just knowing you *could* leave shifts how trapped you feel in the day-to-day.\n\n**Your daughter:** This is the best update you've given me. You apologized, you explained what's happening, you told her you're getting help\u2014and she met you with understanding instead of judgment. That's huge. What she learned in that conversation is that people can struggle, name it, and take steps to get better. That's not her worrying about you in a way that harms her, that's her seeing you model something really important: vulnerability and agency at the same time. The \"made me feel a lot less alone\" part tells me you needed her to know, too\u2014not just for her benefit, but for yours. That's connection. That matters."

      "assistant": "**Medication (one week in):** Still early\u2014most SSRIs/SNRIs take 3-4 weeks before you notice consistent shifts, and even then it's often subtle at first (less like a light switch, more like the volume on your irritability or heaviness turning down a notch). The \"some mornings feel slightly less heavy\" might be real, or it might be placebo, or it might be your brain starting to respond. Hard to know this early. The irritability could be a side effect that levels out, or just your baseline mood still doing its thing while the medication builds up. Keep tracking it, and if the irritability gets worse or new stuff shows up (trouble sleeping, feeling wired, anything that feels off), tell your doctor. You're not imagining things\u2014you're paying attention, which is exactly what you should be doing right now.\n\n**Job search:** You applied to two\u2014that's movement, not just thinking about it. The \"betraying my current job\" feeling is really common even when the job has actively harmed you, because leaving feels like admitting defeat or burning a bridge. But here's the thing: they already betrayed *you* when your manager reframed your boundary as a performance issue. You don't owe loyalty to a place that threw you under the bus. The awkward silence being worse than yelling makes sense\u2014at least yelling is clear. This limbo is crazymaking. You're not betraying anyone by looking. You're protecting yourself.\n\n**Sunday dinner with your mom:** You said yes, and now you're bracing for two things: (1) you'll snap at her, and (2) she'll give you grief about the antidepressants. The fact that she's gotten quieter since you started them\u2014\"like she knows but she's not saying anything\"\u2014might mean she's holding back judgment, or processing her own feelings about it, or waiting for the right moment to say something. You won't know until Sunday. But here's a thought: what if you go in with a plan for if she does bring it up? Not a script, just a simple boundary you can fall back on if she starts in. Something like: \"I'm working with my doctor on this, and I'm not looking for input right now.\" One sentence, then change the subject. That way you're not caught off guard and snapping reactively\u2014you've got a move ready. Does that feel doable, or does even thinking about it make the dinner feel heavier?"

      "user": "so dinner happened. it was... actually not terrible? my mom made pot roast, which is what she does when she's trying to be nice i guess. we talked about surface stuff mostly\u2014my brother's job, her garden, whatever. she didn't bring up the meds at all which was kind of a relief but also made me paranoid like she was biting her tongue the whole time.\n\nbut then at the end when i was leaving she pulled me aside and just said \"i'm proud of you for getting help.\" like that was it. no lecture, no \"i told you to manage stress better,\" nothing. just that. and honestly it threw me off because that's not... that's not her usual move. made me tear up a little which was embarrassing.\n\nwork is still a dumpster fire though. had a one-on-one with my manager today and she basically acted like that meeting with her boss never happened. just moved on to talking about Q4 projections like we're all good. except we're not good. i'm still applying to other stuff. have an interview next week actually.\n\nmeds are still... idk. maybe slightly better? some days the heaviness is less intense but i can't tell if that's real or if i'm just getting used to feeling like this. the irritability thing is still there too. snapped at my daughter yesterday over her leaving dishes in the sink. DISHES. like who even cares right now.\n\nanyway sorry for rambling. just needed to vent i guess.",
      "assistant": "**Your mom:** That \"I'm proud of you for getting help\" hit different because it's the opposite of what you were bracing for. You spent the whole dinner waiting for the other shoe to drop\u2014the lecture, the judgment about meds, the \"you should manage stress better\"\u2014and instead she gave you something you didn't know you needed. The fact that it made you tear up tells me how rare it is to get that kind of acknowledgment from her, and also how much you needed to hear it. Her silence during dinner wasn't necessarily biting her tongue\u2014maybe she was trying, in her way, to just be present without making it about her opinions. That one sentence at the end might be the most she's able to give right now, and it sounds like it mattered.\n\n**Work one-on-one:** Your manager acting like the bus-throwing meeting never happened is a choice\u2014she's trying to reset without repair. That's not the same as things being \"all good,\" and you know it. She wants to move on to Q4 projections because acknowledging what happened would require her to admit she was wrong, and she's not going to do that. You're not crazy for still being pissed. The fact that you have an interview next week means you're not just sitting in this\u2014you're actively building an exit. That matters.\n\n**Medication (still early, maybe slightly better?):** You're two weeks in now, give or take\u2014still in the \"hard to tell if this is real or I'm imagining it\" zone. The heaviness being less intense some days could be the medication starting to work, or it could be your nervous system getting a break from the constant work crisis, or both. The irritability is still showing up (dishes drama with your daughter), which could be a side effect that'll level out, or it could be your baseline mood still doing its thing while the meds build up. Worth mentioning to your doctor at your next check-in, especially if it's not improving by week 4. But yeah\u2014snapping over dishes when you're two weeks into antidepressants, still in a toxic work situation, and managing a complicated relationship with your mom? That's not a moral failure, that's your fuse still being short because you're not out of the woods yet.\n\n**\"Sorry for rambling / just needed to vent\":** You don't need to apologize for this.

But here's the thing: you showed up to the interview while still dealing with all of this. That's not nothing. And if this one doesn't pan out, you'll have more practice for the next one. What would it sound like to name the real reason in a way that's honest but not bitter? Something like: \"I've hit a ceiling in terms of workload management and growth conversations with leadership, and I'm looking for a place where capacity and priorities are handled more collaboratively.\" That's true, it's professional, and it doesn't require you to pretend everything's fine.\n\n**Medication progress:** Three mornings without the car-on-your-chest feeling\u2014that's real.

I don't think you're reading too much into it. Something did change, probably starting with that \"I'm proud of you for getting help\" moment at dinner. She's trying, in her limited way, to show up differently. You don't have to make it mean more than it is, but you also don't have to minimize it. She's doing something new, and you're noticing it.

That's the medication doing what it's supposed to do.\n\n**The restless afternoon energy:** Yeah, that can happen with some antidepressants, especially as they start to kick in\u2014your body's recalibrating and sometimes that shows up as jitteriness or restlessness instead of the flatness you're used to. It's worth mentioning to your doctor at your next check-in, especially if it gets more intense or starts interfering with sleep. Sometimes it levels out on its own after another week or two, sometimes it means the dose needs adjusting or the timing of when you take it needs to shift. But you're right: restless energy beats rage spirals. Just keep tracking it.\n\n**The conversation with your manager:** When you give notice, you don't owe her an explanation beyond \"I've accepted another opportunity.\" If she pushes or tries to guilt you or asks what she could've done differently, you can just say \"I've made my decision\" and let the silence sit. You don't need to relitigate the bus-throwing meeting or explain why you don't trust her anymore. You already know why you're leaving. She doesn't need to understand it."

      "assistant": "**Giving notice:** Ten seconds of staring, then \"are you sure\"\u2014that's her processing that you're actually leaving and she can't guilt-trip or manipulate you into staying. The fact that she didn't counter-offer tells you everything: she knows she burned the bridge, and there's nothing to salvage here. The two-week limbo is going to feel strange because you've already mentally left, but your body still has to show up and pretend. That dissonance is uncomfortable, but it's temporary. You're in the hallway on your way out\u2014just keep walking.\n\n**Restless energy worsening:** Good call mentioning it to your doctor. The fact that it's showing up as constant leg-bouncing and fidgeting in meetings means it's crossing from \"mild side effect\" into \"actually disruptive\" territory. Your doctor's right that it might level out as your body adjusts, but if it doesn't ease up in the next couple weeks, adjusting the dose or timing could help. The key thing is: you're responding well overall (she said it, and the heaviness being way better backs that up), so this is about fine-tuning, not scrapping the whole thing. Keep tracking it\u2014if the restlessness gets worse or starts messing with your sleep, don't wait the full two weeks to check back in.\n\n**Your daughter:** \"Lighter, more like herself\"\u2014you're seeing what happens when she doesn't have to carry the weight of worrying about you. She's a kid again instead of the household emotional barometer. That shift didn't happen because you became perfect or stopped struggling; it happened because you're visibly getting help and she can see you're not drowning anymore. She gets to relax because you're not disappearing into your room or snapping at her over dishes. That's the medication working, yeah, but it's also you doing the work of staying in the ring with her instead of checking out. That matters."

      "assistant": "**Last day at work:** Checked out mentally, physically present\u2014that's exactly where you should be on your last day at a place that threw you under the bus. The fact that packing your desk took fifteen minutes because you didn't have much there *is* symbolic: you never fully settled in because some part of you knew it wasn't safe to. Your manager avoiding you saves you both the performance of pretending this ending is anything other than what it is. You're in the final hours. Tomorrow you're out.\n\n**Restless energy:** I hear you wanting to push through until your next doctor visit, and I get it\u2014you've made it this far, why not keep going. But \"pushing through\" is the same strategy that got you to the point of needing medication in the first place. If the restlessness is genuinely tolerable and not messing with your sleep or ability to function, okay, wait it out. But if it's getting harder to sit through meetings or it starts creeping into your evenings, don't wait\u2014call your doctor's office and ask if you can move the appointment up or do a quick phone check-in. Adjusting a dose takes five minutes and could make the next two weeks way easier. You've earned the right to not suffer through fixable side effects just because you're tough enough to endure them.\n\n**Family dinner with your mom and daughter:** This is different. You can feel it\u2014it's not a trap, it's not her setting you up for a lecture or trying to fix you. She just wants you there. And you're bringing your daughter, which you said you haven't done in forever because you were too in your head to coordinate it. That tells me two things: one, you have bandwidth now that you didn't have before, and two, you trust that this dinner won't be a disaster. The fact that it \"actually doesn't feel like a trap\" means something shifted in how your mom's showing up, or in how you're able to receive her, or both. Either way, you're going because you want to, not because you're obligated or bracing for impact. That's new.\n\n**Sleeping better:** Your body's ready to stop being miserable\u2014yeah, that tracks. When the heaviness lifts and your nervous system isn't in constant threat mode from work stress, sleep often comes back online faster than people expect. You're not lying there for eight hours anymore, you're actually *sleeping*, which means your brain's getting the repair time it needs. That's the medication doing part of it, but it's also the fact that you're not carrying the weight of a toxic job into bed with you anymore. Your body knows you're safe enough to actually rest now."

No performance, no bracing for impact, just people being together in a way that felt easy. The fact that it didn't feel forced tells me something really did shift, both in how your mom's showing up and in how much space you have now to actually be present instead of managing your own crisis.\n\n**Your mom pulling you aside:** She asked the real question\u2014how you're doing with the job transition, the meds, all of it\u2014and you told her the truth instead of the vague deflection you've been giving her for months. That's vulnerability, and she met it exactly right: she listened without trying to fix it or center herself, then said \"I'm glad you're taking care of yourself.\" That's the mom you needed her to be, and she showed up. The fact that she *can* do this\u2014that she's capable of listening without making it about her stuff\u2014makes me think she's been trying to figure out how to show up for you differently ever since that \"I'm proud of you for getting help\" moment. She's learning too.\n\n**New job starting tomorrow:** Nervous *and* excited\u2014that combination makes sense. Nervous because it's new and you don't know the terrain yet, excited because you're walking into something that isn't actively harmful. That's a huge shift from where you were two months ago when you were drowning under three deadlines and snapping at everyone you love. You've earned this.\n\n**Restless energy / doctor appointment:** Good call bumping up the appointment even though it's not an emergency. \"I don't even care that much anymore\" tells me it's tolerable but still present, which means it's worth addressing before it becomes a bigger thing. Your doctor can tweak the dose or timing, and you'll be set. The fact that you're managing it proactively instead of white-knuckling through it is exactly the move.\n\n**\"What else have I been assuming about people that maybe isn't true?\":** This is the question. You assumed your mom couldn't show up differently, and she did. You assumed the heaviness was just who you are under stress, and it wasn't\u2014it was depression, and it's lifting. You assumed you couldn't leave your job, and you did. When you start questioning your assumptions like this, it opens up a lot of space. What else are you carrying that might not be true?

The fact that it feels unreal tells me how normalized the toxicity was at your old place. You spent so long in an environment where boundaries were ignored and workload was weaponized that basic respect feels like some kind of trick. It's not a trick. This is what it looks like when you're not constantly defending yourself just to exist at work. Let yourself get used to it.\n\n**Restless energy resolved:** The dose adjustment worked\u2014your doctor nailed it. And now you're sleeping through the night most nights, which you called \"a miracle considering where I was a few weeks ago.\" That's not a miracle, that's what happens when depression gets treated and the external stressors ease up enough for your nervous system to actually rest. But I get why it feels miraculous. A few weeks ago you were waking up with a car on your chest. Now you're sleeping. That gap is worth noticing.\n\n**Your daughter: \"you're like actually here now\":** Yeah, that would hit hard. She wasn't being mean, she was naming something true\u2014that before, you were going through the motions but not actually *present*. And now you are. The \"how much time I lost being stuck in that heaviness\" realization is going to sit with you for a while, and that's okay. You don't have to be mad about it or punish yourself for it. Depression takes time, and coming out of it means seeing clearly what it cost you. But here's the other side: your daughter sees you now. She's getting the version of you that's actually there, making dinner together, listening instead of just waiting to escape. That time isn't lost anymore. You're here now.\n\n**Your mom / stable plans:** Actual plans for next weekend instead of vague \"maybe sometime\"\u2014that's what stable looks like.

You were too busy trying to stay afloat. And now that you're not in crisis anymore, you're looking around and realizing: who am I when I'm not stressed and guilty about stuff? That question feels big because it is. You've been defined by what you're managing (work chaos, depression, mom stuff, being a mom yourself) for so long that the idea of doing something just because you want to\u2014not because it solves a problem or fixes someone else\u2014feels almost foreign.\n\nHere's the thing: you don't have to have the answer to \"who am I outside of all that\" right now. You just have to notice that the space exists. What used to be filled with crisis is now... open.

What's one small thing you used to do\u2014or always wanted to try\u2014that wasn't about being productive or fixing something? Not a big commitment, just something that sounds interesting or fun.

That's the old script running: productivity mode, crisis mode, everything has to solve a problem or it doesn't count.

The fact that you bought supplies and they're just sitting there untouched tells me there's still some resistance\u2014maybe fear that you won't be good anymore, or that starting will feel silly, or that you don't deserve to do something just because it's enjoyable.

At some point\u2014not today, but eventually\u2014you might get to relax into the idea that this version of her is real, not a temporary performance. You don't have to force that trust.
