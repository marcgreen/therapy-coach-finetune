      "user": "Hey. So I've been putting off reaching out but things have kind of been piling up and I figured I should actually talk to someone about it instead of just... I dunno, pretending everything's fine.\n\nWork's been rough. There's this coworker, Sarah, who basically makes every meeting miserable. She'll contradict me in front of people, take credit for stuff I did, that kind of thing. I try to stay professional but it's exhausting. My manager knows it's happening but doesn't really do anything about it, which somehow makes it worse? Like at least if he shut it down I'd feel like someone had my back.\n\nAnd then there's the health stuff. I've had this weird pain in my chest on and off for like two months now and honestly I'm kind of freaked out about it. Went to the doctor, they said my heart's fine, did an EKG, all normal. But it still happens and I can't stop thinking about it. Like what if they missed something? I know that's probably anxiety but knowing it's anxiety doesn't really make it stop, you know?\n\nAlso my mom's been calling constantly asking me to help cover some of her bills again. I love her but I'm already stretched thin with my own stuff and it's hard to say no.\n\nAnyway. Yeah. That's where I'm at.",
      "assistant": "**Sarah at work:** That dynamic sounds exhausting\u2014having someone undermine you publicly while your manager watches from the sidelines. The part about your manager knowing but not acting might actually be the harder piece, because it leaves you without backup in a situation where you're already having to manage someone else's behavior. What's it like for you in those meetings when she contradicts you? Do you find yourself bracing for it, or does it still catch you off guard?\n\n**The chest pain:** Two months of intermittent chest pain would freak anyone out, even with a clear EKG. The doctors did their job ruling out the cardiac stuff, which is important\u2014but that doesn't mean the pain isn't real or that your worry about it is irrational. Sometimes our bodies hold tension in ways that feel alarming, and sometimes anxiety about the pain can actually make it more noticeable, which then loops back into more worry. Have you noticed any patterns to when it happens\u2014certain times of day, after specific situations, when you're thinking about work or your mom?\n\n**Your mom and the bills:** It's hard to be stretched thin yourself and still feel responsible for someone else's financial situation, especially your mom. Loving her and needing to protect your own stability aren't mutually exclusive, but it probably doesn't feel that way when she's calling. What happens when you imagine saying no to her next request? What comes up for you?\n\nYou mentioned pretending everything's fine\u2014sounds like you've been carrying this alone for a while. What made now the time to stop doing that?"

      "user": "So I tried that thing where I pay attention to when the chest pain happens. It's basically always when I'm thinking about work stuff or scrolling through health articles at like 2am, which... fine, yeah, that's probably anxiety. But it still *feels* real, you know? Like my brain knowing it's anxiety doesn't actually stop my chest from hurting.\n\nWork got worse, by the way. Sarah did this thing in a meeting yesterday where she presented my analysis as hers, and when I tried to clarify that I'd done it, she was like \"oh yeah, we worked on it together\" except we absolutely did not. My manager was right there. I literally watched him write something down and do nothing. I'm so angry I can barely look at her, which is making everything feel tense and hostile now.\n\nAnd then my mom called three times yesterday. Three times. I didn't answer the last one because I just couldn't do it. Now I feel like shit about that because what if something's actually wrong? But also I can't keep being her personal ATM. This whole thing is exhausting.\n\nI don't know. Maybe I'm just not cut out for any of this right now.",
      "assistant": "**The chest pain pattern:** You found the pattern\u2014work stress and 2am health spiraling\u2014and that actually matters, even though it doesn't make the pain disappear. Your brain knowing it's anxiety and your body stopping the pain are two different things. The pain is real. It's just that the source isn't your heart\u2014it's your nervous system reacting to sustained stress. That's not \"less real,\" it just means the solution isn't cardiac, it's about what's keeping your threat system this activated. What would it be like to treat the pain as a signal that your stress level is too high, rather than evidence that something's medically wrong?\n\nOne thing that might help when the pain hits: there's a technique where you do paced breathing\u20144 seconds in through your nose, hold for 2, then 6 seconds out through your mouth, for about 2 minutes. It sounds simple, but it directly calms your nervous system by activating your vagus nerve. Not because the pain is \"just anxiety\" in a dismissive way, but because your body is stuck in a threat response and this gives it a way out. Worth trying next time it happens?\n\n**Sarah and your manager:** That meeting sounds infuriating. She didn't just take credit\u2014she rewrote reality in real time, and your manager watched it happen and chose documentation over intervention. The anger makes complete sense. You're not imagining hostility; you're responding to someone who is actively undermining you while the person with power to stop it... doesn't. \n\nHere's what I'm noticing: you tried to clarify in the moment, which took courage. A lot of people freeze when that happens. The fact that it didn't work isn't a reflection on you\u2014it's information about the situation you're in. What would it mean to stop expecting your manager to have your back? Not giving up, but adjusting your strategy based on what he's actually doing instead of what he should be doing?\n\n**Your mom:** Three calls, two answers, one ignored, and now you feel terrible. But let's look at what actually happened: you set a boundary when you were tapped out, and the cost of that boundary was guilt, not catastrophe. You're afraid something might be wrong\u2014has there been a pattern of actual emergencies, or is this more about the story that if you don't answer, you're failing her?\n\nHere's the thing: you can love your mom and also not be able to afford to subsidize her life right now. Both are true. The part where you said \"I can't keep being her personal ATM\" sounds pretty clear. What does the guilt say when you think about actually telling her that?\n\n**\"Not cut out for any of this\":** You're dealing with a hostile coworker, a manager who won't manage, physical symptoms from chronic stress, and financial/emotional enmeshment with your mom. That's not \"not cut out for it\"\u2014that's being a human with limits who's currently past them. What if the problem isn't your capacity, but the fact that you're trying to handle all of this alone without changing anything about the situations themselves?"

      "user": "yeah so i tried the breathing thing when it happened this morning and... i mean it helped? like the panic part eased up after a couple minutes. still felt the chest thing but it was less like \"oh god i'm dying\" and more like \"ok weird sensation, whatever.\" so that's something i guess.\n\nbut then work happened and honestly it kind of undid any progress i made. sarah sent out an email to the whole team about \"our project\" and cc'd our director. our director. like she's escalating now and making it sound like we're partners on this thing. i forwarded it to my manager with a message saying we need to talk about attribution and he just... hasn't responded. it's been eight hours. i'm trying not to spiral about what that means but it feels like he's choosing her side or just doesn't care, and both of those suck.\n\ni haven't called my mom back yet. the guilt's there but honestly i'm so drained from the work stuff that dealing with her money situation feels impossible right now. is that bad? like should i just bite the bullet and have that conversation now or can i actually let myself be tired for a minute before adding more?",
      "assistant": "**The breathing technique:** That shift from \"oh god I'm dying\" to \"ok weird sensation, whatever\" is actually significant. You didn't make the pain disappear\u2014you changed your relationship to it. Your nervous system got the message that this wasn't an emergency, and the panic backed off. That's the tool working exactly as intended. The chest sensation might hang around for a bit while your baseline stress is this high, but you've got a way to keep it from spiraling now. Keep using it when it hits.\n\n**Sarah and the director email:** She's not just taking credit anymore\u2014she's building a paper trail that rewrites your work as collaborative, and she's doing it at a level above your manager. That's strategic. And your manager's eight-hour silence after you explicitly asked to talk about attribution? That's not neutrality. That's a choice. He's either conflict-avoidant to the point of uselessness, or he's decided not to back you, and you're right\u2014both suck.\n\nHere's the question: what happens if you stop waiting for him to do his job? Not because you're giving up, but because his track record says he won't. You've tried clarifying in meetings, you've tried direct communication\u2014what's left is deciding whether you can tolerate this dynamic long-term or if you need to start thinking about your options. That might mean going above him, documenting everything yourself, or quietly job-searching. What feels possible right now?\n\nOne small thing you could try before the next meeting: if Sarah presents your work again, instead of clarifying in the moment, follow up afterward in writing\u2014email her and cc your manager and the director, something like \"Just to clarify roles: I led the analysis on X, you provided feedback on Y. Want to make sure attribution is clear going forward.\" It creates a record without requiring your manager to intervene in real time. Not a fix, but it stops the erasure from being invisible.\n\n**Your mom:** No, it's not bad. You're allowed to be too tired to have a hard conversation right now. The work stuff is a live crisis\u2014Sarah's escalating, your manager's failing you, and you're trying to figure out what to do. Your mom's calls are important, but they're not an emergency unless there's evidence they are. Letting yourself be tired for a minute isn't neglect. It's triage.\n\nWhen you're ready, the conversation you need to have with her probably isn't about this specific bill request\u2014it's about the pattern. Something like: \"I love you and I want to help when I can, but I can't keep covering your bills. It's affecting my own stability.\" That's going to be hard and she might not take it well. But you already know you can't keep doing this. The question is when you have the bandwidth to say it, not whether you should."
