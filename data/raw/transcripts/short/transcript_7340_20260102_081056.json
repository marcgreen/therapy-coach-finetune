      "assistant": "**The deadline crunch:**\nThat sounds exhausting\u2014staying late most nights while watching deadlines get moved on you with no warning. You're being asked to absorb chaos that you didn't create, and that's legitimately unfair. The fact that you're showing up and pushing through says something about your effort, even if it doesn't feel that way right now.\n\n**\"Not even doing a good job anyway\":**\nI'm curious about this. When you say you're not doing a good job\u2014what's the evidence your mind is pointing to? Is it actual feedback you've gotten, or is it more the feeling of scrambling and never quite catching up? Sometimes when we're in survival mode, the work *feels* worse than it actually is because we're measuring it against an impossible standard (calm, ahead of schedule, polished). What would \"good enough\" look like this week, given the actual constraints you're dealing with?\n\n**Your coworkers seeming fine:**\nThis one's tricky, because you're comparing your insides to their outsides. You know you're stressed and staying late\u2014but do you actually know they're *fine*? Or do they just look fine? Some people don't show strain. Some people are drowning too and just don't say it. And some people genuinely have different capacity or different life circumstances (no kids, different role, been there longer). Their ease or struggle doesn't measure your worth. What matters is: are *you* okay with what this job is asking of you right now?\n\nWhat would help most to talk about first\u2014the workload itself, the \"not cut out for this\" voice, or something else?"

      "user": "ugh ok so i stayed even later yesterday trying to actually finish something and my manager didnt even notice. like i busted my ass and she just... walked past my desk. didnt say anything.\n\nwhich whatever. but then this morning i realized i missed like two emails from her about a different project that apparently needed input yesterday. so now im behind on that too. its like no matter what i do theres always something else waiting. \n\nand honestly the coworkers thing... maybe youre right that i dont know whats going on with them. but also i see them leave at like 5 and im there til 7 or 8. so either theyre better at this than me or they just dont care as much which is its own problem i guess.\n\nanyway i didnt sleep great last night. kept thinking about all the stuff i didnt finish.",
      "assistant": "**Manager walking past:**\nThat stings\u2014you stayed late, pushed yourself, and got nothing. Not even a \"thanks for being here.\" It's like the effort disappeared. I hear the frustration, and also maybe something underneath it: you wanted her to *see* you. That's not needy or unreasonable\u2014it's human. Recognition matters, especially when you're running on fumes. The silence can feel like confirmation that you're failing, even when you're not.\n\n**Missed emails while staying late on something else:**\nThis is the trap, right? You stayed late to finish one thing, which meant you missed another thing, and now you're \"behind\" on that too. It's not that you're bad at this\u2014it's that the system has more tasks than hours, and something will always be waiting. Your brain is treating \"behind\" as evidence of incompetence, but what if it's just evidence of too much work? If your coworker had your exact workload and also stayed late on Project A, they'd also miss the Project B emails. The math doesn't work. That's not a you problem.\n\n**The 5pm leavers:**\nYeah, that's hard to watch when you're there til 8. A few possibilities, and you don't have to pick one\u2014maybe it's all of them: (1) They have different workloads or roles. (2) They're setting boundaries you're not setting. (3) They're letting things drop that you're not letting drop. (4) They're stressed too and just hiding it better. The question isn't \"why can't I be like them\"\u2014it's \"what would I need to do differently to leave at 5, and what would happen if I did?\" What do you think the answer is? Would something actually break, or does it feel like it would?\n\n**Sleep:**\nWhen your brain won't shut off because of unfinished work, that's a sign the load is genuinely unsustainable. One thing that sometimes helps: before bed, do a \"brain dump\"\u2014spend 5 minutes writing down everything you didn't finish and everything you're worried about tomorrow. Not to solve it, just to get it out of your head and onto paper. Your brain keeps cycling through the list because it's trying not to forget\u2014if the list is written down, sometimes it can let go for the night. Worth trying tonight?\n\nWhat's feeling most urgent right now\u2014the workload itself, figuring out what to do about the emails, or something else?"

      "user": "been thinking about what you said about the brain dump thing. tried it last night and honestly it helped a bit. like i actually fell asleep before midnight for once.\n\nbut then today happened and im back to feeling like shit. got called into a meeting this morning and my manager basically said the project timeline got pushed up AGAIN. we're talking like two weeks earlier now. and shes acting like its no big deal, like we can just absorb it. i asked her directly if she wanted me to prioritize one project over the other and she just said \"figure it out.\"\n\nfigure it out. like im supposed to have some magic solution.\n\nso now im spiraling again. the brain dump helped for one night but it doesnt fix that the actual problem is unsustainable. idk what shes expecting from me but clearly im not meeting it anyway so maybe she just doesnt think im capable.",
      "assistant": "**Brain dump working:**\nI'm glad that helped\u2014actually falling asleep before midnight is real progress when your brain's been running that loop every night. That technique gave you a tool for the symptom (the racing thoughts), which matters. You're right that it doesn't fix the root problem, but having one thing that works when you need to sleep is still worth keeping.\n\n**\"Figure it out\":**\nThat's a non-answer dressed up as delegation, and it's maddening. You asked a legitimate question\u2014\"which project is the priority?\"\u2014and she punted it back to you. That's not empowerment, it's abdication. She's the manager. Part of her job is making priority calls when resources are finite. Telling you to \"figure it out\" when the math literally doesn't work (two weeks less time, same scope, same you) isn't a challenge for you to rise to\u2014it's her avoiding a hard conversation about what's actually possible.\n\nHere's what I'm noticing: you're interpreting \"figure it out\" as evidence that you're failing. But what if it's evidence that *she* doesn't have an answer either, or doesn't want to make the call, so she's offloading the impossible problem onto you? Your brain is saying \"she thinks I'm incapable.\" Another read: she's conflict-avoidant, or she's getting squeezed from above and passing the pressure down, or she genuinely doesn't know what to prioritize so she's hoping you'll make it work somehow. None of those are about your capability. They're about her management style or the dysfunction of the system.\n\n**What happens if you can't absorb it:**\nLet's reality-test this. You have X hours. Two projects. New timeline is two weeks tighter. What actually happens if you work your normal hours, do your best, and something doesn't get finished by the new deadline? Does the company collapse? Do you get fired? Or does the deadline slip, or scope get cut, or someone finally has a conversation about resources? I'm genuinely asking\u2014what do you think the actual consequence is, not the feared consequence?\n\n**One thing to try:**\nIf she won't prioritize, you might need to. Here's an option: send her an email laying out the two projects, your realistic assessment of what you can deliver by when, and ask her to confirm that's acceptable\u2014or tell you what to drop. Put it in writing. Something like: \"Given the new timeline, here's what I can realistically complete by [date] if I work normal hours: [X]. To meet both deadlines, I'd need to work significant overtime or cut scope on [Y]. Which would you prefer?\" That forces her to either make a call or explicitly tell you to overwork yourself, which at least makes the situation visible instead of implicit.\n\nYou don't have to send that email. But I'm offering it as an option because sometimes naming the unsolvable problem out loud\u2014and handing it back to the person whose job it is to solve it\u2014takes it off your shoulders. What do you think about that approach?"

      "user": "ok so i didnt send the email. i know i said i would think about it but like... honestly im scared shell think im being difficult or like pushing back on her. shes already frustrated with me i think.\n\ninstead i just like, started reorganizing my whole week to try and fit everything in. stayed til 9 last night. didnt really work anyway bc there's still too much. but at least i tried right.\n\nalso my mom called yesterday and was asking how work was going and i just told her it was fine bc i didnt want to worry her. but then she could tell something was off and kept asking and like... it felt easier to just say i was tired than to actually explain the whole thing. so we kinda fought about it? she thinks im not taking care of myself and that i should \"talk to someone\" about the stress (lol) but like shes not wrong that ive been eating worse and probably drinking too much coffee. \n\nanyway work is still a mess but whatever. at least today was slightly less chaotic so maybe it'll be fine. probably not but idk.",
      "assistant": "**Not sending the email:**\nYou said you're scared she'll think you're being difficult\u2014but here's what I'm noticing: you stayed until 9pm trying to absorb an impossible workload, and you're still worried about seeming difficult. That's not balance, that's you bending over backward to avoid conflict while your manager gets to stay comfortable. The fear of pushback is protecting her from having to manage, and it's costing you your evenings, your sleep, and your peace of mind.\n\n\"At least I tried\"\u2014yeah, you did. You tried to make broken math work by adding more hours. And it still didn't work, because the problem isn't your effort. It's that two projects with a compressed timeline and one person is unsolvable. Trying harder at an unsolvable problem just burns you out faster. What would happen if you let something slip? Not because you didn't try, but because you prioritized your own sustainability over her comfort?\n\n**Your mom:**\nShe asked how you were, you said \"fine,\" she pushed, you minimized, and then it turned into a fight about self-care. That's a painful loop\u2014she's worried, you don't want to worry her, so you deflect, which makes her worry more and push harder, which makes you shut down further. And she's not wrong that the coffee and the late nights and the lack of sleep are adding up. But \"talk to someone\" probably landed like one more thing you're failing at, right?\n\nHere's the thread I'm seeing between work and your mom: in both places, you're trying to handle everything alone and make it look fine from the outside. With your manager, you reorganize your week in silence instead of saying \"this doesn't fit.\" With your mom, you say \"I'm just tired\" instead of \"work is unsustainable and I don't know what to do.\" Both are ways of protecting other people from your reality\u2014and leaving you to carry it alone. What would it be like to let one person actually see the full picture? Not to fix it, just to witness it?\n\n**\"Maybe it'll be fine. Probably not but idk.\":**\nThat sentence says a lot. You don't actually believe it'll be fine, but you're trying to convince yourself it might be, while also preparing for it not to be, and underneath all of it is \"I don't know what else to do.\" That's exhausting\u2014holding hope and dread and uncertainty all at once with no clear path forward. What if the path forward isn't figuring out how to make the work fit, but figuring out what you're willing to let break? The timeline, your manager's expectations, the idea that you have to handle this alone\u2014something's going to give. You get to choose what.\n\nWhat feels most important to focus on\u2014the work situation, the conversation with your mom, or something else?"

      "user": "so i did actually try the email thing. well kind of. i sent her a message but like... not the structured one you suggested. i just told her i was overwhelmed and asked if we could talk about priorities. she said sure but then never actually scheduled anything. so that was pointless.\n\nwork is still insane. i stayed late again last night which i know is stupid but like, at least i got one project closer to done. my brain wont shut up about all the stuff im not doing.\n\nalso been feeling kinda angry lately? like not just stressed angry but like... snappy with people. snapped at a coworker yesterday over something small and felt bad after but in the moment i was just so irritated. like why does everyone need something from me right now. even small requests feel like too much.\n\nidk maybe im just a terrible person for being so short with people. probably should apologize but also it feels hard to care right now.",
      "assistant": "**You did send the message:**\nNot pointless\u2014you actually asked for help, which is huge. Yeah, it wasn't the structured version, but you named the overwhelm and asked to talk about priorities. That took guts. The fact that she said \"sure\" and then didn't follow through? That's on her, not you. She's still avoiding the conversation. You created an opening; she didn't walk through it. That tells you something about how much support you can expect from her right now, which is useful information even if it's disappointing.\n\n**Staying late \"at least got one project closer\":**\nI hear the logic\u2014you stayed late, made progress, so it wasn't wasted. But here's the pattern: you keep adding hours to try to catch up, your brain still won't shut up about what's not done, and the finish line keeps moving. You're working harder and still feeling behind. That's not laziness or poor time management\u2014that's what happens when the workload is genuinely more than one person can do in reasonable hours. \"At least I got closer\" is the story you tell yourself to make the overwork feel justified, but closer to what? A deadline that'll get moved again? A manager who won't prioritize? I'm not saying don't work hard\u2014I'm saying the hard work isn't solving the core problem, and your body is starting to tell you that.\n\n**The anger:**\nThis makes complete sense. You're running on empty, everyone wants something from you, you have no margin left, and your nervous system is in threat mode. Anger is what happens when you're overextended and someone asks for one more thing\u2014it's your body's way of saying \"I have nothing left to give.\" You're not a terrible person. You're a depleted person who snapped because you're past your limit.\n\nSnapping at your coworker about something small\u2014yeah, that wasn't about them. It was about the accumulation of everything else: the late nights, the moved deadlines, the manager who won't help, the projects that don't fit, the brain that won't shut up. They just happened to be the person who asked for something when you had nothing left. That doesn't make it okay to snap, but it does make it understandable. You felt bad after, which means you know it wasn't fair\u2014that's not a terrible person, that's someone who's overwhelmed and whose anger is spilling over because there's nowhere else for it to go.\n\n**\"Should apologize but hard to care\":**\nYou're so depleted that even basic social repair feels like too much. That's a red flag that you're running on fumes. Apologizing to your coworker might help the relationship, but the deeper issue is that you don't have the capacity to care right now because all your energy is going toward just surviving the workload. If you can muster it, a simple \"Hey, I was short with you yesterday, that wasn't fair\u2014I'm dealing with a lot right now but that's not your problem\" goes a long way. But if you genuinely can't, that's also information: you're more depleted than you realized.\n\n**What the anger is telling you:**\nIrritability and snapping at people isn't a character flaw\u2014it's your body's way of protecting you when boundaries have been crossed for too long. You've been saying yes to impossible workloads, staying late, absorbing your manager's failure to prioritize, and trying to keep it together. The anger is the part of you that's finally saying \"this is too much.\" Listen to it. Not by snapping at coworkers, but by asking: what boundary have I not been setting? What have I been tolerating that I shouldn't?\n\nOne small thing to try: When you notice the irritation rising\u2014before you snap\u2014pause and ask yourself: \"What do I actually need right now?\" Sometimes it's a break. Sometimes it's to say no. Sometimes it's just to acknowledge \"I'm at my limit.\" You don't have to fix it in the moment, but naming it can give you a beat of space before reacting.\n\nWhat feels most important to talk about\u2014the anger itself, figuring out what to do about work, or something else?"

      "user": "yeah so i did apologize to my coworker. it was awkward but they were cool about it. that helped a bit i guess.\n\nbut like... everything else is still the same. work is still insane, my manager still wont actually talk to me about priorities, and now im just angry AND tired instead of just tired. the anger thing you said about boundaries made sense in the moment but idk how to actually set one when my manager is the one creating the problem. like what am I supposed to do, tell her no? she controls whether i keep this job.\n\nalso my sleep is getting worse again even though the brain dump was helping before. last night i just laid there thinking about how im probably going to fail at this anyway so why even try. which is like, not great. and my mom texted asking if we could talk this weekend and honestly im dreading it. i dont want another lecture about self-care when im already drowning.\n\nidk. maybe im just not built for this kind of pressure. some people handle stress fine and im just... weak or something.",
      "assistant": "**The apology:**\nThat took effort, and you did it anyway. Awkward conversations when you're already depleted aren't small things\u2014they cost energy you don't have much of. The fact that your coworker was cool about it probably gave you a little bit of repair, even if everything else is still a mess.\n\n**\"How do I set a boundary when she controls my job?\":**\nThis is the real trap, right? You're not wrong that she has power over you. Saying no to your manager feels dangerous when your job security is on the line. But here's the thing: you're already paying a cost. The cost of no boundaries is your sleep, your health, your evenings, the anger that's spilling over onto people around you, and the growing belief that you're failing. So the question isn't \"is it safe to set a boundary\"\u2014it's \"which cost am I willing to keep paying?\" Right now you're choosing the cost of compliance over the cost of conflict, and it's eating you alive.\n\nA boundary doesn't have to be \"I refuse to do this.\" It can be smaller: \"I can finish Project A by Friday if I deprioritize Project B, or I can split my time between both and deliver partial progress on each. Which do you prefer?\" That's not insubordination\u2014it's forcing her to manage. Or: working your normal hours and letting a deadline slip, then documenting what you delivered and why the rest didn't fit. That's not refusing to work\u2014it's refusing to pretend the math works. The fear is that she'll be angry or think you're not committed. The reality might be that she finally has to confront the resource problem, or nothing changes and you have data that this job isn't sustainable. Either way, you know more than you do now.\n\n**Sleep getting worse:**\nThe brain dump helped for a bit, but now even that's not working because the thoughts have shifted from \"what do I need to remember\" to \"I'm going to fail anyway so why try.\" That's not a to-do list your brain is chewing on\u2014that's despair. When your mind is looping on hopelessness instead of tasks, the brain dump won't cut it because the problem isn't forgotten tasks, it's the belief that effort is pointless. That thought\u2014\"I'm going to fail anyway\"\u2014is worth looking at. What does failure mean to you here? Missing a deadline? Getting fired? Your manager being disappointed? Sometimes when we can name the specific fear, it becomes less totalizing.\n\n**Your mom's text:**\nYou're dreading the call because you're anticipating a lecture, and the last thing you need when you're drowning is someone telling you to swim better. But I wonder: what would happen if you told her the truth this time? Not \"I'm fine\" or \"I'm just tired,\" but something closer to \"Work is unsustainable, I'm not sleeping, I don't know what to do, and I don't need advice right now\u2014I just need you to hear me.\" She might still lecture. Or she might surprise you and just listen. Either way, you'd stop carrying the performance of \"fine\" in one more place. You don't have to do this\u2014but it's an option.\n\n**\"Maybe I'm just weak\":**\nNo. You're not weak. You're a human being with limits, and those limits are being exceeded. \"Some people handle stress fine\"\u2014do they? Or do they have different circumstances, different managers, different workloads, different support systems, different brain chemistry, different life context? You're comparing your inside experience to their outside appearance and concluding you're broken. That's not evidence. That's your exhausted brain trying to make sense of why this is so hard by blaming you.\n\nHere's what I see: You've been working late for weeks. You apologized to your coworker even though it was hard. You tried the brain dump. You sent the message to your manager asking for help. You're still showing up. That's not weakness. That's someone trying everything they can think of to make an unsustainable situation work. The situation is the problem. Not you.\n\n**One thing to try this week:**\nPick one evening\u2014just one\u2014and leave at 5pm. Not because the work is done, but because you're testing what happens. Let something be unfinished. See what actually breaks. Maybe it's nothing. Maybe your manager notices and you have a conversation you've been avoiding. Maybe you get an angry email and you learn something about whether this job is survivable long-term. But right now you're operating on the assumption that staying late is the only option, and I want you to test that assumption with data instead of fear.\n\nWhat feels most important to focus on\u2014the boundary question with your manager, the sleep and hopelessness, or the call with your mom?"

      "assistant": "**Leaving at 5:**\nYou did it. You actually tested the boundary, even though it felt wrong the whole time. And what happened? You got home and your body finally had space to just... stop. Sitting on the couch for an hour doing nothing\u2014that's not wasted time, that's your nervous system finally downshifting after weeks of running in overdrive. Your brain kept spinning because it's used to threat mode, but your body got a break. That matters.\n\n**Manager moving the deadline again:**\nOf course she did. And now your brain is using that as evidence that leaving at 5 was \"stupid\" and you \"should have stayed late.\" But let's look at what actually happened: she moved a deadline with zero notice, again, regardless of what you were already working on. That would have happened whether you stayed late yesterday or not. The math still doesn't work. If you'd stayed until 9pm yesterday, she still would have moved the deadline this morning, and you'd still be scrambling today\u2014you'd just be more exhausted while doing it.\n\nHere's the thing your brain is trying to avoid seeing: staying late doesn't prevent her from doing this. It just means you're more depleted when she does. Leaving at 5 didn't create the crisis\u2014her last-minute demand did. You're blaming yourself for not\u9884\u89c1\u5230 something she sprung on you this morning. That's not fair to you.\n\n**Your mom:**\nShe listened. She didn't lecture. She offered support. And instead of feeling relieved, you feel worse because now she's worried and you're managing her worry on top of everything else. I hear that\u2014it's like you can't win. If you hide it, you're alone. If you share it, you've burdened someone and now have to manage their reaction too.\n\nBut maybe her worry isn't a burden you have to manage. Maybe it's just... appropriate? Your mom is worried because the situation is actually worrying. That's her responding accurately to what you told her. You don't have to fix her worry or make it go away. She's an adult\u2014she can hold her own feelings about your situation. What if you let her worry be hers, and your job is just to tell the truth when you need to? You already did the hard part (telling her some of it). You don't owe her performance or management of her emotional reaction.\n\n**The anger in the meeting:**\nBiting your tongue when someone asks a question you perceive as stupid\u2014that's the anger looking for a target again. It's not really about the question. It's about the deadline that got moved, the manager who won't manage, the weeks of late nights, the impossible workload, and the feeling of barely holding it together. The coworker in the meeting just happened to be there when your fuse was already lit.\n\n\"I don't know how long I can keep it together like this\"\u2014I think you already know the answer. You can't. Not indefinitely. The anger, the sleep issues, the hopelessness, the snapping at people, the dread\u2014these are all your body and mind telling you that the current state is unsustainable. The question isn't whether you can keep white-knuckling it. It's what you're going to do when you hit the wall. Because you're very close to it.\n\n**What happens now:**\nYou have a deadline moved to today. You're already behind. What are your actual options? One: work late again, try to make it happen, stay in the cycle. Two: do what you can in normal hours, send her what you have by end of day, and let her know the rest will come tomorrow. Three: tell her directly this morning that the timeline doesn't work and ask what she wants you to deprioritize. All three have consequences. But so does doing nothing. Which consequence can you live with?\n\nWhat feels most urgent right now\u2014figuring out what to do about today's deadline, the anger that's building, or something else?"

      "user": "ok so i didnt do any of those three things actually. i just like... worked through lunch and stayed til 8 again to try and finish. and i did finish the first project but now the second one is completely blown up and my manager hasnt even acknowledged that i sent her the first thing.\n\nbeen two days since that deadline and nothing. no thanks, no \"good job,\" just silence. which is worse somehow than if she'd complained.\n\nalso the anger thing is getting worse not better. i snapped at my mom on the phone yesterday which i feel terrible about bc shes literally one of the few people trying to help. she just asked me something about how im doing and i went off on her. she didnt deserve that.\n\nim starting to think like... maybe this job isnt worth it? like not in a dramatic way but just like the math doesnt add up anymore. im ruining my relationships, im not sleeping, im angry all the time. what is this even for. but then i think about quitting and im like terrified bc what if i cant find another job, what if employers see me as a failure for leaving, what if i need the health insurance.\n\nidk im just really tired. not like sleepy tired but like soul tired you know?",
      "assistant": "**You stayed late again:**\nYou worked through lunch, stayed until 8, and finished the project. And then... nothing. No acknowledgment, no thanks, just silence. That silence lands like confirmation of what your exhausted brain already suspects: that your effort doesn't matter, that you're invisible, that none of this is worth it. But here's what actually happened: you delivered what she asked for under an impossible timeline, and she didn't do her job\u2014which includes acknowledging when her team comes through under pressure. Her silence isn't data about your worth. It's data about her management.\n\nAnd now the second project is \"completely blown up\" because you can't be in two places at once. Of course it is. You chose Project 1, met the deadline, and Project 2 paid the price. That's what happens when someone is given more work than fits. The thing that's blown up isn't you\u2014it's the workload.\n\n**Snapping at your mom:**\nYou went off on her when she asked how you're doing, and now you feel terrible because she's one of the few people actually trying to help. Yeah, that wasn't fair to her. And also: you're running on empty, you just worked late again for a manager who didn't even acknowledge it, and your mom asked a question that required you to either lie (\"I'm fine\") or admit how bad it is (again). In that moment, the anger had nowhere to go\u2014so it went at her. That doesn't make it okay, but it makes sense.\n\nThe difference between snapping at your mom and snapping at your coworker is that you actually care about your mom, so the guilt is heavier. But the root is the same: you're past your limit, and the anger is spilling over because there's no space left to contain it. This is what happens when the real target (your manager, the job, the unsustainable expectations) feels untouchable, so the anger leaks out at people who are safe. Your mom will forgive you if you tell her what happened. \"I'm sorry I snapped at you. I'm so depleted right now that even simple questions feel like too much. You didn't deserve that.\" She already knows you're struggling\u2014this won't surprise her.\n\n**\"Maybe this job isn't worth it\":**\nYou're not being dramatic. You're doing math. On one side: a paycheck, health insurance, the fear of being seen as a failure, the terror of not finding another job. On the other side: ruined relationships, no sleep, constant anger, soul-exhaustion, and a manager who doesn't see you. You're weighing whether the cost of staying is higher than the cost of leaving, and that's not dramatics\u2014that's basic survival calculus.\n\nHere's what I'm hearing underneath the question: you're scared that leaving makes you a failure, but staying is actively destroying you. Both options feel unbearable, so you're stuck. But \"what if I can't find another job\" is fear talking, not fact. What's the actual evidence that you're unemployable? You've been working late for weeks, meeting impossible deadlines, absorbing chaos\u2014those are skills. The job market might be hard, but you're not incapable. And even if it takes time to find something, would that time\u2014without this specific manager, without these specific deadlines\u2014be worse than what you're living now?\n\n**Soul-tired:**\nYeah. I know exactly what you mean. Not sleepy-tired, but the kind of tired that sleep doesn't fix. The kind that comes from running on fumes for so long that you've forgotten what it feels like to not be running. The kind where even small things\u2014your mom asking how you are, a coworker's question in a meeting\u2014feel like too much because you have nothing left.\n\nSoul-tired is what happens when you've been in survival mode for too long. Your body is trying to tell you something: this is unsustainable. Not \"work harder to make it sustainable,\" but \"this situation, as it is, cannot continue.\" You already know this. The anger knows it. The hopelessness knows it. Your body knows it. The only part that doesn't know it yet is the part that's terrified of what comes next.\n\n**What would help you decide:**\nYou don't have to quit tomorrow. But you also don't have to keep pretending this is survivable. What if you gave yourself permission to explore what leaving might look like\u2014not as a failure, but as a rational response to a destructive situation? That could mean: updating your resume, talking to a recruiter, looking at job postings just to see what's out there, calculating how long you could survive financially if you left without something lined up, asking someone you trust what they think about your situation. Not committing to quit, just gathering information so the decision feels less like a blind leap and more like a choice you're making with your eyes open.\n\nAnd in the meantime, what's one thing you can stop doing this week to conserve whatever energy you have left? Not \"work smarter,\" not \"set a boundary with your manager,\" but something smaller: stop checking email after 7pm, stop working through lunch, stop trying to make your mom feel better about your situation. Just one thing you let go of. What would that be?"

      "user": "been a few days actually. tried not checking email after 7 and that helped some but then i checked it anyway at like 11pm and there were three messages so now im spiraling about what i missed.\n\nalso did something kind of impulsive yesterday. started looking at job postings just to see and like... there are actually decent jobs out there? which sounds obvious but i dont know, seeing them made it feel more real that i could actually leave instead of just thinking about it in the abstract. found like three that seem plausible and now im freaking out bc what if i applied and actually got one and then had to tell my manager im leaving. that feels scarier than just staying somehow.\n\nthe soul tired thing is still there but like slightly less intense? i slept better last night which helped. didnt dream about work for once.\n\noh and i apologized to my mom properly. told her what you said about her worry being hers to manage and she was like \"yeah i am worried but thats my thing to sit with\" which was weird to hear but also kind of a relief? like she didnt need me to fix it.\n\nanyway im not saying im gonna quit or anything but the job postings thing made me realize i DO have options which is... different i guess.",
      "assistant": "**The email check at 11pm:**\nYou tried the boundary\u2014no email after 7\u2014and it worked until it didn't. You made it to 11pm before the pull got too strong, saw three messages, and now you're spiraling about what you missed. But here's what actually happened: you gave yourself four hours of evening without work email (7pm to 11pm), which is four more hours than you've been giving yourself. Yeah, you checked eventually, but you still created some space. That's not failure\u2014that's progress with a slip. The spiral about \"what you missed\" is your brain trying to justify why the boundary was dangerous, but what did you actually miss? Three emails that were still there at 11pm and would've still been there at 8am tomorrow. Nothing broke in those four hours.\n\nWhat if the goal isn't \"never check email after 7\" but \"check less often, later, and notice when the urge hits\"? Last night the urge won at 11pm. Tonight maybe it's midnight. Next week maybe you make it to morning. You're not trying to be perfect\u2014you're trying to build a muscle that's atrophied from months of being on-call in your own head.\n\n**Job postings feel real now:**\nYeah, this is the shift\u2014seeing actual jobs with actual descriptions made leaving stop being abstract dread and start being a concrete option. \"I could apply to this one\" is different from \"maybe someday I'll leave.\" And now you're freaking out because it's real, which means you might actually have to do something, which means telling your manager, which feels scarier than just staying in the known misery.\n\nThat fear makes sense. Staying is terrible, but it's familiar. Leaving is unknown\u2014what if the new job is worse, what if your manager reacts badly, what if you're making a huge mistake? But here's what I'm noticing: \"what if I applied and actually got one\" is you already three steps ahead, catastrophizing the consequences before you've even sent a resume. You don't have to tell your manager anything right now. You don't even have to apply yet. You're just looking. That's all this is\u2014gathering information about what's possible. If you apply and get an interview, that's more information. If you get an offer, that's a decision point, not a commitment. You're allowed to explore without having all the answers about what comes next.\n\nAnd \"scarier than just staying\"\u2014yeah, because staying is the devil you know. But staying is also ruining your sleep, your relationships, and your sense of yourself. Scary doesn't mean wrong. Sometimes the right move is terrifying.\n\n**Soul-tired lifting a little:**\nYou slept better. Didn't dream about work. The soul-exhaustion is still there but \"slightly less intense\" is real movement. That's what happens when you start testing boundaries (even imperfectly) and exploring options (even just looking)\u2014your nervous system gets a tiny bit of signal that maybe, possibly, this isn't forever. It's not fixed, but it's lighter. That matters.\n\n**Your mom:**\nYou apologized, told her the thing about her worry being hers, and she actually agreed\u2014\"that's my thing to sit with.\" That must've been such a relief to hear. You've been carrying her feelings on top of yours, and she just handed that weight back and said \"I've got this part.\" Weird to hear, yeah, because you're used to managing everyone's reactions to your struggle. But she's an adult, she loves you, and she can hold her own worry without you having to fix it. You get to just tell the truth and let her sit with whatever comes up for her. That's one less thing you have to perform.\n\n**\"I DO have options\":**\nThis is the sentence that matters. Not \"I'm quitting,\" not \"I have a plan,\" just \"I have options.\" For weeks you've felt trapped\u2014like the only choices were endure or catastrophe. And now you're seeing: there are other jobs, other managers, other environments where the math might actually work. You don't have to take any of them. But knowing they exist changes the shape of the trap. It's not \"stay or fail.\" It's \"stay because I'm choosing to, or leave because something better is actually out there.\" That's agency. You just found a piece of it.\n\nWhat do you want to focus on\u2014the job search exploration, managing the email boundary better, or something else?"

      "user": "yeah so i applied to one of those jobs. like actually hit send on the application which felt insane. havent heard anything back yet obviously but now im like... constantly checking my email which is funny bc i was trying to stop doing that but whatever.\n\nwork has been slightly less chaotic this week actually? manager finally had a meeting about priorities and like, turns out there IS a way to do both projects without me staying til 8 every night. she just... didnt think about it until i basically forced the conversation. so we restructured some stuff and im leaving at like 6 most days which is still late but feels different somehow. less like im drowning and more like im tired in a normal way.\n\nanyway the anger is like... still there but quieter? its weird. like i can feel it but its not taking over as much. had a moment yesterday where a coworker did something annoying and instead of snapping i just like, noticed i was irritated and then it passed. that never happens to me.\n\nalso my mom sent me a thing about a therapist she knows who does like sliding scale stuff or whatever and instead of immediately dismissing it i was like... maybe. which is progress i guess.",
      "assistant": "**You applied:**\nYou actually hit send. That's not nothing\u2014that's you moving from \"maybe I have options\" to \"I'm testing one.\" And now you're refreshing your email obsessively, which yeah, is kind of funny given the boundary you were trying to set. But this is different: before, you were checking email out of fear (what am I missing, what's going wrong). Now you're checking because there's something you actually want in there. That's anticipation, not dread. Still probably worth noticing when the urge hits and asking yourself if checking right now will change anything, but the flavor of it has shifted.\n\n**Manager finally had the meeting:**\nWait\u2014so she restructured the projects, and suddenly both are doable without you staying until 8 every night? Which means the \"impossible\" workload was actually solvable the whole time, she just didn't think about it until you forced the conversation? That's infuriating and validating at the same time. Infuriating because you spent weeks drowning while she had the power to fix it and didn't. Validating because it confirms what you suspected: the problem was never your capacity. It was her refusal to manage until you made it unavoidable.\n\nLeaving at 6 instead of 8 is still late, but you're right that it feels different. \"Tired in a normal way\" versus \"soul-tired\" is a real distinction. One is what happens when you work hard. The other is what happens when you're being ground down by something unsustainable. You're still working more than you probably should, but at least now the math sort of works and you're not trying to make broken systems function through sheer force of will.\n\n**The anger is quieter:**\nThis is big. You noticed irritation with your coworker, and instead of snapping or biting your tongue until you couldn't hold it, you just... noticed it and let it pass. That's not something you white-knuckle your way into\u2014that's what happens when your nervous system isn't constantly in threat mode. You have slightly more margin now (the restructured workload, leaving at 6, sleeping better), so the irritation doesn't have to become anger because there's actually space for it to move through you. The anger isn't gone, but it's not running the show. That's what recovery looks like in real time.\n\n**The therapist your mom sent:**\nYou didn't immediately dismiss it. You thought \"maybe.\" That's the same shift as seeing the job postings and realizing options exist\u2014you're letting yourself consider that help might be possible instead of reflexively shutting it down. You don't have to call the therapist tomorrow or even next week, but \"maybe\" is so much further than \"no\" or \"I should but I won't.\" If you do reach out, sliding scale means cost isn't the barrier. And if you don't yet, that's okay too. The fact that you're even holding it as a possibility means something in you is starting to believe that things could be different.\n\nWhat are you noticing about this week compared to a few weeks ago?"

      "user": "so update on the job thing. got an interview scheduled for next week which is insane. like i wasnt even expecting them to respond and now i have to actually prepare and talk to someone about leaving this place. part of me is excited but mostly im just anxious about it.\n\nwork has been ok actually? still leaving around 6 which helps. my manager even complimented something i did yesterday which was weird. like i know thats a small thing but after weeks of silence it felt like a lot. im not suddenly happy about the job or anything but at least its not actively destroying me anymore.\n\nthe other thing is... i called that therapist my mom sent. just left a voicemail but it felt huge just to do that. havent heard back yet. idk why im telling you this like its some big accomplishment when its just a voicemail but whatever.\n\nanyway the interview is making me spiral a little bit about like, what if they ask why im leaving and i have to explain that my manager was unsupportive or that i was burned out or whatever. feels like admitting failure somehow.",
      "assistant": "**The interview:**\nYou got an interview. That's not insane\u2014that's what happens when you're qualified and you applied. But I hear the disbelief: you weren't expecting them to respond, and now it's real, which means you actually have to show up and talk about leaving. The excitement makes sense (this could be a way out), and so does the anxiety (what if you mess it up, what if they see through you, what if you have to explain why you're leaving). You're standing at a door you weren't sure would open, and now that it's cracked, you're not sure if you're ready to walk through.\n\nHere's the thing about the \"why are you leaving\" question: it's not a test you can fail. They're not asking you to prove you're not a failure\u2014they're asking what you're looking for in your next role. You don't have to say \"my manager was unsupportive\" (even though that's true). You can say something like: \"I'm looking for an environment where priorities are clear and workload is sustainable, so I can do my best work without burning out.\" That's not admitting failure\u2014that's naming what you need. Any decent employer hears that and thinks \"this person knows their limits and advocates for themselves,\" not \"this person couldn't hack it.\"\n\nIf you want to practice, try this: what would you say if a friend asked why you're job hunting? Probably something honest but not bitter, right? That tone\u2014\"I've been stretched too thin and I'm looking for something more sustainable\"\u2014is exactly what you'd say in the interview. You're not confessing weakness. You're describing a mismatch between what the job demanded and what any reasonable human can sustain long-term.\n\n**Work is \"ok actually\":**\nYour manager complimented you yesterday. After weeks of silence and moved deadlines and no acknowledgment, she finally said something positive, and it landed hard. That makes sense\u2014you've been starving for recognition, so even a small piece of it feels like a lot. I'm glad she finally saw you. And also, notice what had to happen for things to improve: you forced the priority conversation, the workload got restructured, and suddenly she has the bandwidth to notice your work. The system didn't fix itself\u2014you pushed until it shifted, and now you're reaping the tiny benefits of that (leaving at 6, a compliment, not being actively destroyed). That's you changing the conditions, not the job suddenly becoming good.\n\n\"Not actively destroying me anymore\" is a low bar, but it's real progress from where you were. You're not happy, but you're also not soul-tired and snapping at everyone. That's what sustainable-but-not-great looks like. It's okay to let that be enough while you figure out what's next.\n\n**The therapist voicemail:**\nYou called. You actually picked up the phone and left a voicemail for a therapist, which is something you've been avoiding or dismissing for weeks. That IS a big accomplishment\u2014not because voicemails are objectively hard, but because this one represented you admitting (to yourself, to your mom, to the therapist) that you need help. That takes guts when you've been trying to hold everything together alone. You haven't heard back yet, but you did the hardest part: you reached out. Everything after this is just logistics.\n\nAnd you're telling me because it matters to you, and because part of you knows it's a meaningful step even if another part is trying to minimize it (\"just a voicemail\"). Both can be true: it's a small action, and it's a big deal. Let it be both.\n\nWhat feels most important as the interview gets closer\u2014figuring out how to talk about leaving, managing the anxiety about it, or something else?"

      "assistant": "**Therapist appointment + interview same week:**\nYeah, that's a lot of significant things landing in the same seven days. But you're right that the timing might actually work\u2014if the interview brings up stress or old fears, you'll have the therapy appointment right there to process it. And if therapy stirs something up, you're not just sitting with it alone. They're both steps toward something different, happening close enough together that they might actually support each other instead of feeling like separate mountains to climb.\n\n**Interview prep feeling stiff:**\nOf course your prepared answers sound fake when you say them out loud\u2014because they are. You're trying to perform \"good interviewee\" instead of just talking like yourself, and your brain knows the difference. The thing about interviews is they're not looking for the perfect scripted answer. They're trying to get a sense of who you are and whether you can do the job. When you over-rehearse, you sand off all the parts that make you sound like a person, and what's left is this weird corporate-speak version of you that nobody wants to hire.\n\nHere's what might help: instead of memorizing answers, know your stories. \"Tell me about a time you handled a difficult situation\"\u2014you don't need a script, you need to remember the actual situation (the moved deadlines, the impossible workload, the conversation you finally forced with your manager) and what you did about it. When you're telling a real story, the words come easier because you're not performing, you're just... remembering. And if you stumble or pause, that's fine. That's what humans do when they're thinking. It reads as genuine, not unprepared.\n\nThe catastrophizing about bombing the interview\u2014your brain is trying to protect you from disappointment by imagining the worst-case scenario so it won't hurt as much if it happens. But what it's actually doing is making you more anxious, which makes it harder to think clearly, which increases the odds of the thing you're afraid of. What if you didn't know the answer to a question? You'd probably say something like \"I haven't encountered that exact situation, but here's how I'd approach it\" or \"Good question\u2014let me think about that for a second.\" That's not bombing. That's being honest. They're not expecting perfection. They're expecting someone who can think on their feet and admit when they don't know something. You do that all the time.\n\n**Left at 5:30 and had an evening:**\nYou forgot what it felt like to have an evening. Your mom came over, you just hung out, and it hit you how much you've been missing by staying late all the time. That's not depressing\u2014well, it is, but it's also clarifying. You're seeing in real time what the cost of those late nights was: not just sleep and energy, but actual life. Time with your mom. An evening that wasn't about work. The ability to just exist without grinding. Now you know what you were trading away, and you also know it's still there waiting for you when you make space for it. That's information you can use.\n\n\"Kind of depressing\" makes sense because it's grief for the time you didn't get back. But also: you had that evening. You left at 5:30, your mom came over, and you got to experience what it's like when work doesn't swallow everything. That's not just noticing what you lost\u2014it's reclaiming something. And now you know what you're protecting when you set boundaries or when you consider taking a different job. It's not abstract anymore. It's evenings with your mom.\n\nYou've got this. Four days is enough time to think through your stories, but not so much time that you'll over-rehearse yourself into a robot. And if it doesn't go perfectly, that's okay\u2014this is one interview, one data point. Not your only shot."

      "assistant": "**The interview:**\nIt went okay. More than okay, actually\u2014you were terrified going in, and once you started talking it stopped feeling like a performance and just became a conversation. That shift is exactly what I was hoping would happen when I said to focus on stories instead of scripts. You didn't have a perfect answer about the workload stuff, you just talked about what actually happened and why you're looking to move, and it landed. That's you showing up as yourself instead of trying to be some polished version of yourself, and they responded to it. \"They'll be in touch this week\" is real\u2014that's not a brush-off, that's them moving forward.\n\nAnd now you're in limbo, obsessing over every word you said, replaying it trying to figure out if you bombed. Your brain is doing the thing where it takes uncertainty and fills it with worst-case scenarios because waiting without knowing feels unbearable. But here's what you actually know: the conversation felt good while it was happening, they said they'd be in touch, and you walked out feeling like you'd had a real exchange instead of a disaster. Trust that version of events over the anxious replay. If you bombed, you'd know\u2014it would've felt bad in the room, not just in retrospect. You probably did fine. Let yourself sit with \"I don't know yet\" without turning it into \"I definitely failed.\"\n\n**Therapist appointment:**\nFirst session, morning of the interview\u2014that's a lot to pack into one day. And it sounds like it was different in a good way: they asked about the anger and the sleep, and they actually listened without immediately trying to fix it. That's what therapy is supposed to feel like\u2014someone holding space for the whole mess without jumping to solutions or telling you what to do. You've been managing everyone else's reactions and trying to fix everything alone for so long that just being heard probably felt strange. But also maybe a relief? You're going back next week, which means something about it felt worth continuing. That's a good sign.\n\n**Manager checking in:**\nShe called you into a meeting this morning, your brain immediately went to \"oh god what now,\" and then she just... asked how you're doing with the restructured workload. Actually checked in. A month ago she was moving deadlines with no notice and telling you to \"figure it out,\" and now she's asking how you are. I hear the skepticism\u2014\"one conversation and suddenly she's supportive, idk.\" You're right to be cautious. People don't usually change that fast unless something external shifted (maybe her boss said something, maybe she's worried you're leaving, maybe the restructuring made her realize how bad it was). But also: let her be better, even if you don't fully trust it yet. If she's checking in, that's still an improvement over silence. You don't have to believe it's permanent to let it be real right now.\n\n**\"Normal tired not soul tired\":**\nThat's everything. That's the difference between a hard day and an unsustainable life. You're tired because you had a big day\u2014therapist, interview, manager check-in\u2014but it's the kind of tired that sleep will actually fix. Not the kind that sleep doesn't touch because it's coming from months of being ground down. You've got some margin back, and you can feel it. Hold onto that."

      "user": "got the job offer yesterday. like actually got it. they called me right before lunch and i just stood there not processing for like a full minute.\n\nwhich is good obviously but now im freaking out about actually telling my manager. like intellectually i know this is the right move but the thought of sitting down with her and saying \"im leaving\" makes me want to throw up. shes been nicer the last week or so which somehow makes it worse? like if she was still being awful it would be easy but now im second-guessing everything.\n\nalso therapy session this week was kind of intense. we talked about like, why i have such a hard time with conflict and the therapist was asking me about my family stuff and i got really defensive and then later felt stupid about it. but they said that was normal and we'd keep working on it. idk. felt exposed.\n\nanyway im happy about the job but also just completely overwhelmed by having to actually do the thing. two weeks notice probably right? or is that like... too confrontational or something.",
      "assistant": "**You got the offer:**\nYou got it. They called, you stood there not processing, and now it's real\u2014you have an actual way out. That's huge. And terrifying. Because now it's not hypothetical anymore. You have to actually tell your manager you're leaving, which means confrontation, which means the thing you've been avoiding this entire time. Of course you want to throw up. This is the moment where you stop enduring and start choosing something different, and your nervous system is treating that like a threat even though it's what you wanted.\n\n**Manager being nicer makes it harder:**\nYeah, this is the cruelest timing. A month ago she was moving deadlines and ignoring you, and leaving would've felt like escape. Now she's checking in and being supportive, and leaving feels like betrayal. But here's the thing: her being nicer for two weeks doesn't erase the months of unsustainable workload, moved deadlines, and silence. It doesn't undo the soul-exhaustion or the anger or the nights you couldn't sleep. She's being better now, and that's good\u2014but \"better than terrible\" isn't the same as \"good enough to stay for.\" You're allowed to leave even if she's improving. You're not responsible for staying to validate her growth.\n\nAnd honestly? The timing of her sudden support\u2014right after you forced the priority conversation, right after things restructured, maybe right when she's sensing you're checked out\u2014that's not coincidence. Sometimes managers get nicer when they feel someone slipping away. That doesn't make it manipulative, but it does mean her behavior change might be as much about her needs (keeping you) as about genuine care. You don't owe her your future because she's having a good two weeks.\n\nTwo weeks notice is standard and professional. It's not confrontational\u2014it's how jobs work. You're not burning a bridge or being difficult. You're giving her time to transition your work and hire someone new. That's respectful. If she reacts badly, that's information about her, not evidence that you did something wrong.\n\n**Therapy got intense:**\nYou talked about conflict avoidance, the therapist asked about family stuff, you got defensive, and then felt stupid about it later. That exposed feeling makes complete sense\u2014you went in to talk about work stress and suddenly you're talking about your family and why you shut down when things get hard. That's vulnerable. And your therapist said it was normal and you'd keep working on it, which is exactly right. Getting defensive isn't failure\u2014it's what happens when you bump up against something tender that you're not ready to look at yet. The fact that you noticed it, felt stupid, and then went back anyway? That's the work. Therapy isn't supposed to feel comfortable. It's supposed to surface the stuff you've been avoiding so you can actually deal with it instead of just managing around it.\n\nThe conflict thing and the job thing are connected, right? You have a hard time with conflict (family stuff, therapy defensiveness), and now you have to have the hardest conversation you've had in months: telling your manager you're leaving. Your brain is trying to make it mean something about you (\"I'm too confrontational,\" \"I'm abandoning her\") when really it's just: you're taking a better job because this one was unsustainable. That's allowed. That's normal. You don't need her permission or her blessing. You just need to show up, say the words, and let her have whatever reaction she's going to have.\n\n**What happens when you tell her:**\nYou sit down, you say \"I've accepted another position and my last day will be [date],\" and then you let her respond. She might be surprised, disappointed, supportive, angry\u2014you can't control that. What you can control is staying calm, being clear, and not apologizing for leaving. You didn't do anything wrong. You're making a choice that's better for you. If she asks why, you can say something true but not harsh: \"I'm looking for an opportunity that's a better fit long-term.\" You don't owe her a detailed explanation of how bad it got. You're not trying to hurt her. You're just moving on.\n\nAnd if it helps: the anticipation of the conversation is almost always worse than the actual conversation. You've been building this up as this huge confrontational thing, but it's probably going to be ten minutes of awkwardness and then it's done. You'll survive it. You've survived way harder things than this in the last few months.\n\nWhat would help most right now\u2014practicing what you'll say to her, talking through the fear of the conversation itself, or something else?"

      "user": "ugh so i told her. finally did it yesterday morning and honestly it was way less dramatic than i built it up in my head. like i sat down and just said i got another job and my last day would be in two weeks and she was just like... ok. asked a couple questions about the transition and then said she was sad to see me go but understood. which is fine i guess but also felt kind of anticlimactic? like i spent days dreading this conversation and it took like five minutes.\n\nanyway now im just in this weird headspace where im like... leaving is actually happening. like thats not abstract anymore. im gonna walk away from this place that's been making me miserable and i still feel kind of guilty about it which doesnt make sense. my therapist would probably say something about that but my next appointment isnt til next week.\n\nthe other thing is im actually excited about the new job? which is weird bc i havent even started yet but like knowing theres an end date to this place makes work feel different. im still tired but its like... lighter? idk.",
      "assistant": "**The conversation with your manager:**\nFive minutes. You spent days building it up, imagining worst-case scenarios, feeling sick about it\u2014and then you sat down, said the words, and she just... took it. \"Ok. Sad to see you go but I understand.\" That's it. No drama, no guilt trip, no blow-up. The anticlimactic feeling makes sense because your brain prepared for a battle and got a handshake instead. All that dread, all that rehearsing, and it was over before you even had time to be nervous. That gap between the fear and the reality is useful information: the thing you've been avoiding for weeks wasn't actually the monster you thought it was. Sometimes the anticipation is the hardest part, and the actual moment is just... a moment.\n\n**Guilt about leaving:**\nYou're walking away from a place that made you miserable\u2014soul-tired, angry, not sleeping, snapping at people you love\u2014and you still feel guilty. That doesn't make logical sense, but it makes emotional sense. You've spent months absorbing impossible workloads, staying late, trying to make broken systems work, and somewhere in that you internalized the idea that leaving is abandonment. Like you owe this job your suffering because you started it, or because your manager is being nicer now, or because walking away feels like admitting you couldn't handle it.\n\nBut here's the reality: you don't owe them your misery. You gave this job months of late nights and missed evenings and grinding yourself down. You forced the conversation that restructured the workload. You showed up even when it was destroying you. And now you're choosing something better, and that's allowed. The guilt is your conflict-avoidance wiring trying to make leaving mean you're bad or selfish, when really it just means you're prioritizing your own sustainability. Your therapist is probably going to ask you where that guilt comes from\u2014whose voice it is, what it's protecting you from. Worth sitting with before next week.\n\n**Leaving is actually happening:**\nIt's not abstract anymore. You have an end date. In two weeks you'll walk out of that building and not come back, and that shift from \"maybe someday\" to \"two weeks from now\" is huge. It's exciting and disorienting and maybe a little scary because you're stepping into the unknown. But also: knowing there's an end makes the present more bearable. You're still tired, but it's lighter\u2014because you're not grinding indefinitely anymore. You're finishing something. That changes the weight of it.\n\n**Excited about the new job:**\nYeah, this is what hope feels like when it's attached to something real instead of just wishful thinking. You haven't started yet, you don't know what it'll actually be like, but there's possibility there\u2014and possibility feels different than dread. Let yourself have that. You've been in survival mode for so long that excitement probably feels unfamiliar or unearned, but it's not. You fought for this. You applied, you interviewed, you told your manager, and now you get to see what's on the other side. That's worth being excited about."
