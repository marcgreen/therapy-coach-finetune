      "user": "So work has been absolutely relentless. My manager dumped three new projects on my desk last week, all with overlapping deadlines. I'm talking end of month, mid-February, and one that supposedly was due yesterday but somehow got extended. I don't even know where to start. I've been staying late most nights, skipping lunch, the usual.\n\nMy sleep's been terrible. I'm either wired at 2am thinking about everything I haven't finished, or I crash hard and wake up groggy. Yesterday I snapped at my partner over something completely stupid, which never happens. They didn't deserve that.\n\nAnyway, I've also been thinking about what's going on with my mood lately. Some days I feel fine, normal. Other days I wake up and everything feels heavy. Like, existentially heavy. Not just tired or frustrated, but like nothing matters much. It's strange because I can't point to one thing that sets it off. Just some mornings it's there and some it's not.",
      "assistant": "**Work overload:** Three overlapping deadlines with no clear starting point would overwhelm anyone. The fact that you're already skipping meals and staying late tells me you're running on fumes. When everything feels equally urgent, it's hard to know what to prioritize\u2014your brain just goes into survival mode. What happens if you look at those three projects and ask: which one, if it slipped, would cause the least damage? Sometimes giving yourself permission to triage instead of trying to do everything perfectly creates just enough breathing room.\n\n**The snap at your partner:** You're carrying a ton right now, and yesterday it spilled over. It happens. The fact that you noticed and that it's unusual for you says something\u2014you're not disconnected, you're stretched thin. Have you had a chance to acknowledge it with them?\n\n**The mood thing:** This one stands out to me. You're describing something that feels less reactive and more... ambient. Some mornings it's just there, unprompted. That heaviness you're talking about\u2014\"nothing matters much\"\u2014is worth paying attention to, especially if it's showing up without an obvious trigger. How long have you been noticing this pattern? And on the days when it lifts, is there anything different about those days, or does it just seem random?\n\nOne thing I'm wondering: the work stress, the sleep disruption, and these mood shifts might all be feeding each other. Chronic stress can absolutely mess with both sleep architecture and baseline mood regulation. But it's also possible that something else is going on underneath the work chaos that's worth exploring. What's your sense\u2014does the heaviness feel like it's *because* of the work situation, or does it feel separate?"

      "user": "Work got worse, which is great. The extended deadline? Turns out that was a miscommunication. It's actually due Friday, not next week. So now I'm juggling all three at once basically.\n\nI tried your thing about prioritizing. Looked at them this morning and honestly they all feel equally critical. The client on project two is threatening to escalate if we miss mid-February, and project one is tied to a product launch. Hard to say one matters less when they all have teeth.\n\nSleep's still garbage. Been averaging maybe five hours. I know that's bad. I'm aware. Just can't seem to shut my brain off even when I'm exhausted.\n\nBut here's the thing about the mood stuff. It came back this morning, that heaviness. Woke up and just felt it sitting there. My partner asked how I slept and I couldn't even answer. Didn't feel like talking. Just wanted coffee and to stare at my computer. They let it go, which was kind of them. I don't think it's the work stress triggering it though. Or at least not directly. This feels different. The work thing is noise on top of something quieter.",
      "assistant": "**The deadline miscommunication:** That's brutal timing. You went from thinking you had breathing room to realizing everything's colliding at once. When you tried to triage and all three projects have real consequences attached\u2014client escalation, product launch\u2014yeah, there's no good answer there. You're not failing to prioritize; you're stuck in a situation where the system itself is broken. The fact that you even tried to step back and assess says you're still thinking clearly despite running on five hours of sleep.\n\n**Sleep at five hours:** You know it's unsustainable. I'm not going to pile on about that. But here's what's worth naming: when your brain won't shut off even when you're exhausted, that's often a sign that your nervous system is stuck in overdrive. It's not about willpower or discipline\u2014it's physiology. Your body thinks there's a threat (deadlines, client escalation), so it won't let you fully power down. One thing that might help: about 30-60 minutes before bed, try a hard cutoff on work and screens. Give your brain a different task\u2014something mundane, not stimulating. Some people do dishes, some read fiction, some do a short walk. The goal isn't to relax, exactly\u2014it's to signal to your system that the threat window is closed for today. Worth trying?\n\n**The mood heaviness:** This part I want to sit with. You're describing something that showed up again this morning, uninvited. You couldn't even answer your partner when they asked how you slept\u2014not because you were mad or avoiding them, but because talking itself felt like too much. And you're naming something really important: this feels separate from the work chaos. The work is noise on top of something quieter.\n\nThat distinction matters. When something feels ambient like this\u2014present on some mornings but not others, not clearly tied to external events\u2014it's often worth tracking more closely. How long has this pattern been going on? Weeks? Months? And on the mornings when it's not there, does anything feel different, or is it just... gone?\n\nI'm also curious: when the heaviness is there, does it stay all day, or does it shift as the day goes on? Sometimes these things have a pattern\u2014worse in the morning, lifts by afternoon, or the opposite. If there's a time-of-day pattern, that can actually be a useful clue.\n\nOne more thing: you said \"nothing matters much\" in your first message. When that feeling is present, does it affect how you see the work deadlines, or does the work stress still feel urgent and separate from the heaviness?"

      "user": "Been a few days. Work is still insane\u2014finished project one, but now the other two are both demanding attention simultaneously. The client did escalate, which was fun. My manager's leaning on me hard and honestly I don't see how this gets resolved by mid-February without something breaking.\n\nSleep's been slightly better maybe, like six hours instead of five. Tried the cutoff thing you mentioned\u2014stopped work at 9pm, did some reading. Helped a bit. Not a miracle, but I notice I'm not as wired at midnight.\n\nThe mood thing though. That's what's actually concerning me. It's been there more days than not now. This morning I woke up and just... didn't want to get out of bed. Not because I'm tired. Just the weight of it. My partner brought me coffee and I could barely look at them. I feel guilty about that, like I'm being distant on purpose, but it's not a choice. It's like I'm behind glass or something.\n\nI've had this before, years ago, and I remember what it felt like. This reminds me of that. Back then it took months to lift. I don't have months right now. I have two projects and a client who's already angry.",
      "assistant": "**Work pressure:** You finished project one\u2014that's real progress even if it doesn't feel like it in the middle of this. The client escalation and your manager leaning on you hard, though... that's a system problem, not a you problem. There's only so much one person can absorb before something gives. When you say \"something breaking,\" what comes to mind? Is it the deadlines slipping, or something in you?\n\n**Sleep improvement:** Six hours instead of five, and you're noticing you're not as wired at midnight\u2014that's movement. The 9pm cutoff and reading are doing what they're supposed to: giving your nervous system a signal that the day is over. Keep that going if you can. It's not fixing everything, but it's one thing that's working.\n\n**The mood heaviness:** This is what I'm most focused on right now. You woke up and didn't want to get out of bed\u2014not from exhaustion, but from the weight of it. Your partner brought you coffee and you could barely look at them. You're describing what it feels like to be behind glass: present physically, but unreachable. And you're recognizing this pattern because you've been here before, years ago, and it took months to lift.\n\nHere's what I want to name: you're describing something that sounds like depression. The ambient heaviness, the mornings where nothing feels worth doing, the sense of disconnection from your partner even when you don't want to be distant, the fact that it's showing up more days than not\u2014that's not just work stress bleeding over. That's its own thing, and it deserves its own attention.\n\nThe fact that you've had this before and you're recognizing it now is actually important. You know what this is. You know it doesn't resolve on its own quickly. And I hear the conflict: you don't have months right now because the work demands are immediate and relentless.\n\nBut here's the reality: if this is depression showing up again, trying to outrun it or push through it while also managing impossible work deadlines isn't going to work. It's going to burn you down faster. The work will still be there, but you'll have even less capacity to handle it.\n\nSo let me ask directly: What would it look like to get some support for this? Have you thought about reaching out to a therapist, or if you've worked with someone before, reconnecting with them? I know that feels like one more thing on an impossible list, but this isn't something you should be trying to manage alone while also carrying everything else.\n\nIn the meantime, one small thing you could try: on the mornings when the heaviness is there and getting out of bed feels impossible, what if you gave yourself a tiny goal\u2014just one. Not \"start working\" or \"be productive.\" Something like: make coffee, or sit outside for two minutes, or text your partner \"having a heavy morning, not you.\" Something that requires almost nothing but keeps you connected to the day in some small way. Not because it'll fix the heaviness, but because it gives you one foothold when everything feels like too much.\n\nHow does that land? And what's your sense about reaching out for more formal support\u2014where are you with that idea?"

      "user": "So I did reach out to my therapist from before. Left a message on Wednesday saying I needed an appointment, that things were getting bad. They called back yesterday and could fit me in next Tuesday. That's almost a week away but at least there's a date now. Part of me feels relieved, part of me feels like I'm admitting defeat or something, which is stupid.\n\nWork's actually shifted a bit. The client meeting happened on Monday and it went better than expected. Turns out the escalation was partly miscommunication on their end too. Still tight timeline but less of a complete crisis. My manager even said I could push one deadline back by a few days if needed. So there's that.\n\nBut the mood thing hasn't really changed much. If anything it's been there more consistently. I woke up this morning and couldn't bring myself to shower until like 2pm. Just sat in my apartment. My partner's being patient but I can feel them getting worried, which makes it worse because now I'm also worried about worrying them. It's exhausting.\n\nThe sleep's helping a bit though. I'm getting closer to seven hours most nights, which I know is still not enough but it's better. At least my brain's not doing the 2am spiral anymore.",
      "assistant": "**Reaching out to your therapist:** You left that message Wednesday when things were getting bad, and now you have Tuesday marked on the calendar. That's not admitting defeat\u2014that's recognizing a pattern you've seen before and doing something about it before it takes months to climb out of. The fact that part of you feels like it's defeat tells me something about how you're wired: you're used to handling things yourself, and asking for help feels like failing. But here's another way to look at it: you know what this is, you know it doesn't resolve on its own, and you made the call anyway. That's not weakness. That's you taking it seriously.\n\n**Work easing up:** The client meeting went better than expected, the escalation was partly their miscommunication, and your manager gave you room to push a deadline back. That's real relief, even if it doesn't solve everything. You went from \"something's going to break\" to \"still tight but manageable.\" That matters. How does it feel now that some of that pressure is off?\n\n**The mood heaviness:** This is the part that's not shifting. You woke up this morning and couldn't shower until 2pm\u2014just sat in your apartment. That kind of inertia, where even basic tasks feel impossible, is one of the clearest signs that depression is active right now. It's not about motivation or discipline. It's your brain struggling to generate the energy to initiate anything, even things that objectively take two minutes.\n\nAnd then there's the layer on top: your partner's worry is making you worry about worrying them. That's a recursive loop that adds weight to something that's already heavy. You're not just dealing with the depression itself\u2014you're also managing guilt and concern about how it's affecting someone you care about. That's exhausting in a way that's hard to explain to people who haven't been there.\n\nOne thing that might help with your partner: sometimes naming it directly takes some of the tension out. Something like, \"I'm in a depressive episode right now and I know it's hard to watch. I'm seeing my therapist Tuesday. I'm not ignoring you, I'm just behind glass for a bit.\" You don't have to explain or justify\u2014just name what's happening. Sometimes that clarity is easier for both of you than the unspoken worry floating around.\n\n**Sleep improving:** Seven hours most nights, no more 2am spirals\u2014that's meaningful progress. Sleep won't fix the depression on its own, but it gives you a slightly better foundation to work from. And it's one thing that's responding to what you're doing, which matters when everything else feels stuck.\n\nBetween now and Tuesday, keep doing what's working: the 9pm cutoff, the reading, the small morning footholds when you can manage them. You don't have to fix this before the appointment. You just have to get there. How are you feeling about seeing your therapist again after all this time?"

      "user": "Quick update. Saw my therapist Tuesday like planned. First appointment back with them in maybe four years. It was... necessary, I guess. They asked a lot of questions about the timeline, when things shifted, whether there were any major changes before the heaviness started. I told them about work, about the sleep, about waking up and not being able to move. They want me on something\u2014antidepressant, probably an SSRI. We're starting low dose, seeing how it goes. Takes a few weeks to feel anything supposedly.\n\nPart of me knows that's the right call. Part of me is annoyed I'm back here again. Like my brain's just broken and I have to medicate it to function like a normal person.\n\nWork's actually fine now. The deadline extensions help. I'm caught up enough that I'm not in crisis mode anymore. Finished two of the three projects. It's... fine.\n\nBut the heaviness is still there. This morning was rough. Got out of bed eventually but it took effort. My partner made breakfast and I just sat there picking at it. They asked if I was okay and I said yes, which wasn't honest. Just didn't have energy for the conversation. Anyway, the medication should help with that supposedly.",
      "assistant": "**Therapy appointment:** You went back after four years and it was necessary\u2014I hear both parts of that. Necessary means you recognized you needed support, and you showed up even though part of you resents being back in this place. Your therapist asked the right questions: timeline, when it shifted, what preceded it. That's them trying to understand the shape of this episode, not just throw medication at it. And now you're starting an SSRI, low dose, with the reality that it'll be a few weeks before you feel anything. That waiting period is frustrating when you're already tired of feeling this way.\n\nThe part of you that's annoyed makes complete sense. \"My brain's just broken and I have to medicate it to function like a normal person\"\u2014that's a painful way to frame it, but I get why you're there. Here's another way to think about it, if it helps: your brain's neurochemistry is doing something right now that makes generating energy, motivation, and emotional responsiveness harder than it should be. Medication doesn't fix a broken brain\u2014it adjusts the chemistry so your brain can do what it's trying to do. Some people need glasses to see clearly. Some people need insulin for blood sugar regulation. Some people need SSRIs to stabilize mood regulation. It's not moral failure, it's biology. But I also know that intellectually understanding that doesn't always make the resentment go away. How much of the annoyance is about needing medication, and how much is about being back in a place you thought you'd left behind?\n\n**Work settling:** Two of three projects done, deadlines extended, no longer in crisis mode. That's real progress. You went from \"something's going to break\" to \"it's fine.\" I notice the flatness in how you're describing it though\u2014\"it's... fine.\" Is that because the work stress genuinely resolved, or because the depression is making it hard to feel much about anything, even relief?\n\n**This morning:** You got out of bed but it took effort. Your partner made breakfast and you picked at it. They asked if you were okay and you said yes, even though it wasn't true. You didn't have energy for the conversation. That disconnection\u2014being physically present but unable to reach across the space to connect\u2014is one of the hardest parts of depression, both for you and for them. You're not withholding on purpose. You're just depleted.\n\nOne thing to consider: your partner's asking because they care, and they probably already know the answer isn't \"yes.\" Sometimes the honest version doesn't have to be a long conversation. It can be as simple as, \"Not really, but I don't have words for it right now. It's the depression, not you.\" That gives them information without requiring you to perform or explain when you don't have the capacity. Would something like that feel manageable, or does even that feel like too much?\n\n**The medication timeline:** You're right that it'll take a few weeks to feel anything, which means you're in this holding pattern where the heaviness is still fully present and you're waiting for the chemistry to shift. That's a hard space to sit in. In the meantime, what you're already doing\u2014sleep hygiene, small morning goals when you can manage them, showing up to therapy\u2014those are the things that hold the line until the medication kicks in. You're not fixing it yet. You're just keeping yourself afloat until you have more tools working for you.\n\nHow are you doing with the waiting? And what's your plan for the next few weeks while the SSRI ramps up\u2014are you seeing your therapist weekly, or is it more spaced out?"

All three done, deadlines met. My manager was pleased, which is fine. I did the work. But honestly I can't feel good about it. It's like I completed them in a fog.

That's the frustrating part of SSRIs: you're showing up, doing the work, and your brain's chemistry is still catching up. The waiting feels passive when you're used to solving problems by doing something. But you're not doing nothing\u2014you're giving the medication time to work, which is actually the only thing that moves this forward. Still sucks to sit in it though.\n\n**All three projects done:** You wrapped the third one yesterday, met all the deadlines, your manager was pleased. That's objectively significant\u2014a few weeks ago you were juggling impossible timelines and wondering what would break. Now they're all done. But you can't feel good about it. You completed them in a fog. You don't even remember what the second project involved. That's depression doing what it does: it takes accomplishments and flattens them into nothing. You did the thing, but your brain won't let you register it as mattering. That disconnect\u2014between what you achieved and what you can feel about it\u2014is one of the most isolating parts of this.\n\n**Your partner stopped asking:** They figured out you're just going to say yes anyway, so they stopped. You're framing that as \"probably fine, one less thing,\" but I'm wondering if it actually is. On one hand, yeah, it takes pressure off when you don't have the energy to explain. On the other hand, that silence can start to feel like distance neither of you intended. You sat with them at dinner last night, didn't really engage, just ate and went to bed early. You could tell they noticed but you didn't talk about it.\n\nHere's what I'm hearing: you're both trying not to burden each other. They're not asking because they don't want to pressure you. You're not sharing because you don't want to worry them. But that mutual silence can become its own kind of weight. What if you tried naming it once, not as a big conversation, just as a check-in? Something like: \"I know I've been really distant lately. It's the depression, not you. I'm still here, just behind glass for a bit.\" You don't have to explain more than that. But sometimes breaking the silence\u2014even briefly\u2014keeps the connection from eroding while you're waiting for the medication to kick in. Does that feel doable, or does even that feel like too much right now?\n\n**Sleep stable at seven hours:** That's still holding, which matters. It's one thing that's working even while everything else feels stuck. Keep that going.\n\n**Your mom:** You called her, she asked how you were, you said work was intense but fine. Didn't mention the depression. \"Seemed easier that way.\" I get it\u2014sometimes adding more people to the loop feels like it creates more to manage, not less. But I'm curious: is the reason you didn't tell her because you don't think she'd be helpful, or because explaining it felt like too much, or something else? No wrong answer, just wondering what that choice was about for you.\n\nOne thing I want to name as you're waiting for mid-March: you're in a hard in-between space right now. The work crisis resolved, so there's no external drama to point to. The medication hasn't kicked in yet, so there's no relief on the chemistry side. The heaviness is just... there, most mornings, with some days slightly less thick but mostly the same. That kind of persistent low-grade heaviness without obvious peaks or valleys can feel harder to tolerate than acute crisis, because there's no narrative arc\u2014it's just grinding along.\n\nYou're doing what you're supposed to be doing: taking the medication, sleeping, showing up. You're keeping yourself afloat. That's enough for right now. You don't have to feel good about finishing the projects, or be more engaged with your partner, or explain things to your mom. You just have to get through the next few weeks until the SSRI has a chance to do its job.\n\nHow's it feeling to be in this waiting period?

Your brain hears it intellectually but can't convert it into anything that feels like it matters. That disconnect is exhausting in its own way, because you're doing objectively well and getting zero emotional payoff from it. It's like running a race and crossing the finish line but feeling nothing. Just wanted to name that, because it's real even if it doesn't make logical sense.\n\n**Talking to your partner:** You told them you were still behind glass but it wasn't about them. They seemed relieved. Asked if you wanted anything different, you said no, just wanted them to know. And now it's less weird, less pretending. That's real movement. You didn't have a magical breakthrough, but you stopped the mutual silence from becoming distance. Sometimes that's what connection looks like when you're depressed\u2014not deep conversations or emotional intimacy, just honest acknowledgment that lets the other person stop guessing. The fact that it helped even a bit matters. That was a good call on your part.\n\n**Your mom:** She figured out something was going on, asked if you were okay, and you told her the truth. About the depression, the medication, your therapist. And instead of the support you probably hoped for, she got worried in a way that made you the problem she needs to solve. Started asking about diet, exercise, sunlight\u2014like those things are going to fix your brain chemistry. Now you regret telling her at all.\n\nThat reaction from her is so common and so frustrating. She's not trying to be dismissive, but what she's doing is reaching for things she can control because your actual problem\u2014depression, medication, therapy\u2014feels too big or too scary for her to sit with. So she defaults to \"solutions\" that feel manageable to her: diet, exercise, sunlight. It's her anxiety trying to fix you because she doesn't know what else to do. But the effect is that you feel invalidated and like she doesn't get it. You told her something hard and vulnerable, and instead of \"that sounds really difficult, I'm glad you're getting help,\" you got a list of lifestyle interventions.\n\nHere's the thing: you're allowed to regret telling her. You're also allowed to set a boundary about how much you share going forward. If her worry turns into her trying to manage your depression with advice you didn't ask for, you can limit what you tell her. Something like, \"I'm handling it with my therapist, I don't need suggestions right now,\" or just... not updating her on it anymore. You don't owe her access to this part of your life if her response makes it harder for you.\n\nAt the same time, I'm curious: is there a part of you that wishes she'd responded differently? Like, what would helpful support from her have looked like, if she'd been able to offer it? Sometimes naming what we actually needed\u2014even if we didn't get it\u2014helps clarify what we're looking for from other people.\n\nHow are you holding up overall as you get closer to that mid-March check-in with your therapist?"

      "user": "So the mid-March appointment happened. Therapist said the SSRI should be working more by now, so we're bumping the dose up. Apparently what I'm on isn't enough. Great. More waiting, more mornings feeling like this. They said sometimes it takes trial and error to find the right dose, which I guess is just code for \"this could take a while.\" I'm frustrated but what choice do I have.\n\nWork's still solid. No new crisis stuff. My manager asked if I wanted to take on a bigger project and I said yes, which in retrospect maybe wasn't the best call when I'm still feeling like I'm moving through water. But it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. It's a decent opportunity, actually\u2014something I'd normally be excited about. I can't really feel the excitement yet, but logically I know it's good.\n\nThe thing with my mom has been bugging me. I've been thinking about what you asked, about what helpful support would have looked like. Honestly, she just could have said \"I'm sorry you're dealing with this, I'm here if you need anything\" and left it at that. Instead she sent me an article about omega-3s yesterday. An article, like I haven't thought of basic nutrition myself. I didn't respond to it. Felt too petty to engage, so I just didn't.",
      "assistant": "**Dose increase:** Your therapist bumped up the SSRI because what you're on isn't enough yet. More waiting, more mornings waking up feeling like this. \"Trial and error to find the right dose\"\u2014yeah, that's code for \"this could take a while,\" and I hear how exhausting that is to absorb when you've already been patient for weeks. You're frustrated, and that makes complete sense. You've been doing everything right\u2014taking the medication, showing up, waiting\u2014and the payoff keeps getting pushed further out. The reality is that finding the right dose sometimes does take a few adjustments, but that doesn't make it less frustrating to live through. The increased dose will take another 2-4 weeks to show its full effect, which means you're back in that waiting space again. That's hard. You're allowed to be frustrated about it.\n\n**Saying yes to the bigger project:** Your manager asked, you said yes, and now you're second-guessing it because you're still moving through water. But you also said it's a decent opportunity, something you'd normally be excited about. You can't feel the excitement yet, but logically you know it's good. Here's what I'm noticing: you made a decision based on what makes sense for your career, even though your brain can't generate the emotional response that would usually come with it. That's actually a functional choice\u2014you didn't let the depression make the decision for you. Whether it was the \"best call\" timing-wise, I don't know. But it sounds like you weighed it and chose something that aligns with what you want, even if you can't feel that want right now. That's not nothing. How's it sitting with you now that a few days have passed?\n\n**Your mom and the omega-3 article:** You've been sitting with what helpful support would have looked like, and you landed on something simple: \"I'm sorry you're dealing with this, I'm here if you need anything.\" That's it. Just acknowledgment and availability, not solutions. Instead she sent you an article about omega-3s, like you haven't thought of basic nutrition yourself. You didn't respond because engaging felt too petty, so you just didn't.\n\nThat was probably the right call. Responding to the article would have pulled you into a conversation you don't want to have, where you either have to educate her on why that's not helpful or pretend to appreciate it. Neither option serves you. The hard part is that what you're wanting from her\u2014simple acknowledgment without the fixing\u2014might not be something she's capable of giving right now. Her anxiety about your depression is driving her to do *something*, and articles about omega-3s are what she's got. It's not what you need, but it's what she can manage.\n\nOne option, if you want to try it: next time she does this, you could set a gentle boundary. Something like, \"I know you're trying to help, but I'm working with my therapist on this and I don't need suggestions right now. If I want advice I'll ask.\" That might redirect her energy without cutting her off entirely. Or you could just keep not responding to the articles and let her tire herself out. Both are valid. What feels more doable for you?\n\nThe other piece I'm hearing is that you wanted her to see you\u2014not as a problem to fix, but as someone going through something hard who deserves simple support. And she didn't do that. That disappointment is real, and it's okay to feel it. Sometimes the people we want support from the most are the least equipped to give it the way we need it. That doesn't mean you were wrong to tell her. It just means she's showing you her limits, and now you get to decide how much access she gets going forward.\n\nHow are you doing day-to-day as you wait for the new dose to kick in?"

More engaging than the other work was, at least. There's complexity to it that requires actual thinking, which is something. My partner asked yesterday how it was going and I said good, which is probably the most honest I've been about work stuff in months. Doesn't mean I'm suddenly feeling great about it, but it's less fog than before.\n\nAnyway, something else came up that's been sitting with me. My partner and I had a conversation about our relationship stuff. Not a fight or anything. Just... they said they've noticed I've been distant for a while now and they're wondering if this is just temporary or if something's shifted between us. Asked if I still want to be together, which is a fair question I guess. I said yes, but then they asked what that looks like for me right now, and I didn't have a good answer. I told them I didn't know. They seemed hurt by that, understandably. We dropped it after that.\n\nI don't think the depression is the only thing going on here. The work stuff got better but I'm still feeling pretty disconnected from things. Maybe from them too, not just because of the heaviness but like... I don't know. Harder to say.",
      "assistant": "**Medication timeline:** A couple weeks since the dose increase, still waiting for it to do anything you can feel. Your therapist says the second dose sometimes takes longer\u2014that's true, but it doesn't make the waiting less frustrating when you're showing up every day, taking it like clockwork, and still not getting the relief you're looking for. You're doing your part. Your brain's chemistry is still catching up. That gap between effort and result is wearing, and I hear that.\n\n**The bigger project:** Halfway through, more engaging than the other work, requires actual thinking. When your partner asked how it was going, you said \"good\"\u2014and you called that the most honest you've been about work in months. That's real movement. You're not suddenly feeling great about it, but it's less fog than before. The fact that you can notice that difference, even if it's subtle, suggests something might be shifting\u2014maybe the new dose starting to take hold, or maybe just the combination of sleep stability and less acute work crisis giving your brain a bit more room. Either way, that's not nothing.\n\n**The conversation with your partner:** They said you've been distant for a while and asked if it's temporary or if something's shifted between you. Asked if you still want to be together\u2014fair question, given how long you've been behind glass. You said yes. Then they asked what that looks like for you right now, and you didn't have a good answer. You told them you didn't know. They seemed hurt. You dropped it.\n\nThat question\u2014\"what does being together look like for you right now?\"\u2014is a hard one to answer when you're depressed, because depression makes it hard to access what you want or feel about anything, let alone something as complex as a relationship. But here's what I'm noticing: you said \"I don't think the depression is the only thing going on here.\" You're feeling disconnected from things, maybe from them too, not just because of the heaviness but something harder to name.\n\nThat's worth paying attention to. Sometimes depression flattens everything and makes it impossible to feel connection, and when the chemistry stabilizes, the feelings come back. But sometimes depression lifts the veil on something that was already there underneath\u2014a distance or disconnect that existed before the episode but got obscured by everything else. You're not sure which this is yet, and that makes sense. It's hard to know what's the depression and what's actually about the relationship when you're still in the middle of it.\n\nOne thing that might help: instead of trying to answer \"what does being together look like,\" which feels big and abstract, what if you asked yourself a smaller question first? When you think about your partner\u2014not in a depressed fog, but when you imagine the depression lifting\u2014what do you hope is still there? Do you picture wanting to be close to them again, or does that feel like something you're *supposed* to want but can't quite locate? There's no right answer, but your gut response to that question might tell you something about whether the distance is temporary or pointing at something else.\n\nThe other piece is that your partner's hurt makes sense. They asked a vulnerable question\u2014\"do you still want this?\"\u2014and got \"I don't know.\" That's honest, but it also leaves them in limbo, not knowing if they're waiting for you to come back or if you're already gone in some way you haven't named yet. At some point, probably soon, you'll need to come back to this conversation with them. Not with a perfect answer, but with something more than \"I don't know.\" Even if it's, \"I don't know what I feel right now because the depression is still flattening everything, but I want to figure it out with you,\" or \"I'm feeling disconnected and I'm not sure if it's temporary or something bigger, and I need time to sort that out.\" Uncertainty is hard, but it's different than silence.\n\nWhat's your sense right now\u2014when you sit with the question of whether you want to be with them, what comes up? Is it blankness, or is there something under that you can't quite reach yet, or is it something else?"

      "user": "Ugh. So I've been thinking about what you asked, about what I hope is still there when the depression lifts. And honestly I can't tell if I'm avoiding the answer or if the answer actually is just... blank. Like, I try to imagine it and there's nothing. No pull toward them, no sense of \"yes I want that back.\" Just nothing.\n\nWe haven't talked about it again since that conversation. It's been weird and quiet. My partner's being careful around me, like they're not sure what to say anymore. Which makes sense. I dropped an \"I don't know\" on them and then ghosted the conversation.\n\nThe dose still isn't doing much by the way. It's been almost three weeks now. I mentioned it to my therapist yesterday and they said we might need to try something different, which is just fantastic. So potentially a whole new medication to wait out. I said okay, we can try that, but like... at what point do I accept that maybe nothing's going to fix this? I know that's probably the depression talking, that hopeless spiral thing, but it also feels reasonable.\n\nWork's going fine. The project's almost done actually. My manager asked if I wanted to present it to the client, which would normally be some kind of win, and I just said sure. No enthusiasm, but I said yes. I'll do it next week.\n\nHonestly everything feels like it's on pause or something. Like I'm just waiting for medication to work or waiting to figure out my relationship or waiting for the project to be over. Nothing's actually happening, I'm just stuck in limbo somewhere.",
      "assistant": "**The question about what you hope is still there:** You've been sitting with it, trying to imagine what you want when the depression lifts, and what comes up is... nothing. No pull toward them, no \"yes I want that back.\" Just blank. You can't tell if you're avoiding the answer or if the answer actually is blank.\n\nThat blankness is one of the hardest things to interpret when you're depressed, because depression *creates* blankness\u2014it suppresses your ability to access desire, connection, future-oriented thinking. But blankness can also be your gut telling you something true that you don't want to face yet. The tricky part is you won't know which it is until the depression lifts enough for you to feel *something* again. Right now you're trying to make a decision about your relationship from inside a fog that makes everything feel like nothing. That's nearly impossible.\n\nHere's what I'm wondering: if you set aside the question of what you feel *toward them* for a second, what do you feel about your life right now in general? When you think about the future\u2014not your relationship specifically, but just your days ahead\u2014is there anything that generates a pull? A sense of wanting something, looking forward to something, caring about an outcome? Or is the blankness more global than just your partner?\n\nIf it's global\u2014if everything feels like nothing, not just the relationship\u2014then that's the depression doing what it does, and trying to make relationship decisions from inside that state is probably premature. But if there are some things you can still locate a sense of wanting or caring about, and your partner just isn't one of them... that might be telling you something different.\n\n**The conversation you haven't had:** You dropped \"I don't know\" on them and then ghosted the conversation. They're being careful around you now, not sure what to say. That silence is its own kind of answer, and it's probably making the weirdness worse for both of you. At some point soon you're going to need to come back to this, even if you don't have clarity yet. Not because you owe them a decision right now, but because leaving them in limbo without any update is a choice too\u2014it's saying \"I'm not sure, and I'm not going to tell you I'm not sure, so just sit in the uncertainty while I figure it out.\"\n\nWhat if you told them something like this: \"I know I left that conversation hanging and that's not fair to you. The truth is I still don't know what I feel. The depression is flattening everything and I can't tell what's temporary and what's real. I'm not asking you to wait indefinitely, but I also can't give you an answer right now that I trust. I need more time, and I need the medication situation to settle before I can even see clearly enough to know.\" That's not closure, but it's honesty. It gives them information about where you are instead of silence. Does that feel doable, or does even that feel like too much?\n\n**Medication at three weeks, still nothing:** You told your therapist it's not doing much, and now they're talking about trying something different. A whole new medication to wait out. You said okay, but you're also asking: at what point do I accept that maybe nothing's going to fix this? You know that's probably the depression talking\u2014the hopeless spiral\u2014but it also feels reasonable.\n\nIt *is* the depression talking, but that doesn't make the exhaustion less real. You've been patient for months now. First medication, first dose, second dose, now potentially a different medication entirely. Each time it's \"wait a few more weeks,\" and you're still waking up with weight on your chest. That grinds you down, and the hopelessness that comes with it makes sense even if it's not the full picture.\n\nHere's the reality: SSRIs don't work for everyone, and sometimes it takes trying 2-3 different medications before you find one that lands. That process is brutal when you're living it. But \"nothing's going to fix this\" isn't supported by the data\u2014most people do eventually respond to *something*, whether that's a different SSRI, an SNRI, augmentation with another medication, or a different approach entirely. You're not at the end of the road. You're in the middle of the frustrating part where it hasn't worked *yet*. That's not the same as it never working.\n\nBut I also want to name this: if your therapist is suggesting a new medication, that conversation should include *why* they think this one will be different, and what the plan is if this one doesn't work either. You're allowed to ask those questions. You're allowed to say, \"I'm tired of waiting, what's the broader strategy here?\" A good therapist will have answers\u2014whether that's trying a different class of medication, adding therapy modalities like behavioral activation, or considering other interventions. If they're just throwing medication at the wall without a plan, that's worth questioning.\n\n**Work almost done, presenting next week:** The project's almost finished, your manager asked you to present it to the client, you said sure. No enthusiasm, but you said yes. You'll do it next week. That's you continuing to function even when nothing feels like it matters. You're showing up, doing good work, saying yes to opportunities that make sense logically even though your brain won't give you the emotional payoff. That's not nothing, even if it feels empty right now.\n\n**Everything on pause:** You're waiting for medication to work, waiting to figure out your relationship, waiting for the project to be over. Nothing's actually happening, you're just stuck in limbo. That sense of suspended animation\u2014life moving forward mechanically while you're emotionally frozen\u2014is one of the most suffocating parts of depression. You're doing all the right things (medication, therapy, work, trying to think about your relationship), but none of it feels like progress because you can't *feel* anything shifting yet.\n\nHere's what I want to reflect back: you're not stuck because you're failing to do something. You're stuck because you're in a transition space where the old strategies (pushing through, working hard, being patient) aren't generating results fast enough, and the new strategies (medication adjustments, honest conversations) haven't kicked in yet. That in-between space is limbo. It's uncomfortable and it feels like nothing's happening, but things *are* happening\u2014they're just happening slowly and beneath the surface where you can't feel them yet.\n\nThe medication situation needs resolution soon. The relationship conversation needs to happen. But neither of those can be forced before you're ready. What feels most urgent to you right now\u2014getting clarity on the medication plan, or figuring out how to talk to your partner?"

I said I don't know yet and I can't make that decision from inside this fog.

You're starting it this week. More waiting, but at least now there's a plan beyond \"be patient.\" That distinction matters\u2014it's not just trying the same thing again and hoping for different results. SNRIs work on both serotonin and norepinephrine, which can be more effective for people whose depression involves low energy and emotional blunting (which sounds like what you've been describing). It's still another few weeks of waiting for it to kick in, which I know is exhausting to hear, but this is a genuine strategic shift based on how you've responded so far. That's your therapist actually tracking what's working and adjusting the approach, not just throwing medication at the wall. Does it feel different knowing there's reasoning behind the switch, or does it still just feel like more limbo?\n\n**The conversation with your partner:** They asked again what you were thinking about the relationship, and this time you told them the truth\u2014that you can't tell if the blankness is depression or if something shifted, and you can't make that decision from inside the fog.

You're looking at the problem instead of pretending it's not there.\n\nThat's real movement. You didn't have an answer, but you gave them context and honesty instead of just uncertainty. That's the difference between \"I don't know\" (which leaves them nowhere) and \"I don't know yet, here's why, here's what I'm trying to figure out\" (which gives them something to hold onto while you both wait). They're still in an uncomfortable position\u2014waiting to find out if you want to be with them\u2014but at least now they understand what they're waiting *for*. And you stopped pretending the question wasn't there, which probably took some of the tension out of the room. How's it been between you two since that conversation?\n\n**Project presentation:** It went fine, client was happy, manager was happy. You did the thing.

You're functioning\u2014meeting deadlines, presenting to clients, having hard conversations with your partner\u2014but none of it registers emotionally. It's like watching yourself go through the motions from behind glass. The gap between what you're accomplishing and what you can feel about it is demoralizing in a way that's hard to explain to people who haven't been there. You want the fog to lift, and the answer keeps being \"soon, maybe, wait a bit longer.\"\n\nHere's what I can tell you: the SNRI will take 3-4 weeks to show effects, sometimes up to 6-8 for full impact. That means you're looking at late April, maybe early May, before you know if this one's working. I know that's not what you want to hear. But if this medication lands the way your therapist thinks it might, that fog you're describing\u2014the emotional blunting, the inability to feel accomplishment or connection\u2014that's one of the things SNRIs can address more effectively than SSRIs for some people.\n\nIn the meantime, you're doing what you need to do: taking the medication, showing up to work, being honest with your partner when you can manage it. You're not failing because you can't feel things yet. You're holding the line until your brain chemistry catches up. That's enough for right now."

Sometimes when the external pressure drops, the internal exhaustion becomes more obvious because you're not running on adrenaline anymore.\n\nOne thing to track over the next week while you're off: does the exhaustion shift at all, or does it stay constant? If it starts to ease even slightly as the days go on, that might tell you it's partly burnout from the last few months. If it stays exactly the same, that's more likely the medication transition or the depression itself. Either way, it's useful data for your therapist.\n\nYou're tired of trusting the process. That's fair. You've been doing it for a long time with not much to show for it yet. But here's what I'm seeing from the outside: the SNRI is a real strategic shift, not just more of the same. Your relationship with your partner is shifting from tense silence to actual conversation. You chose rest instead of more work. Those aren't dramatic breakthroughs, but they're not nothing either. You're still in the hard part, but you're not in the same place you were two months ago. Does any of that register, or does it all still feel like limbo?"

      "user": "Been a couple days into the week off and honestly it's been weird. Took your suggestion about tracking the exhaustion\u2014it hasn't really shifted. Still waking up tired even though I'm sleeping fine. My therapist was right about the recalibration thing I guess, but knowing that doesn't make it less frustrating.\n\nMy partner and I actually spent time together without it feeling forced. We made dinner together yesterday, which sounds small but we haven't done that in months. They made a joke about something and I almost laughed\u2014like actually almost. Didn't quite get there but it was close. First time I've felt anything close to that in a long time. Might be the medication starting to work, might just be less work stress finally giving my brain room to breathe. Either way it was something.\n\nOh, and I called my mom back. She'd left a couple voicemails over the past week and I finally picked up. Didn't mention the medication stuff\u2014just talked about normal things. Work wrapping up, taking time off. She seemed happy to hear from me actually engaging instead of giving one-word answers like usual. We're not magically close or anything but it was less strained than before. Figured I'd at least answer her calls instead of letting them pile up.\n\nThe exhaustion thing is what's getting to me though. Like, I can feel something shifting slightly with the people around me but my body won't cooperate. It's frustrating.",
      "assistant": "**The exhaustion tracking:** You've been paying attention to it over the past few days, and it hasn't shifted\u2014still waking up tired despite sleeping fine. Your therapist was right about the recalibration, but knowing the reason doesn't make it less frustrating. That's the hard part of these medication transitions: you understand intellectually what's happening (your system adjusting to the SNRI), but your body still feels heavy and uncooperative. The fact that it's holding steady instead of easing suggests it's more likely the medication adjustment than just burnout, which means it should improve as your body acclimates over the next couple weeks. I know that's more waiting, but at least now you have clearer data about what's causing it.\n\n**Dinner with your partner and the almost-laugh:** You made dinner together yesterday\u2014first time in months. They made a joke and you almost laughed. Actually almost. Didn't quite get there, but it was close. First time you've felt anything like that in a long time.\n\nThat moment matters. You almost laughed. Your brain generated something close to a spontaneous emotional response to humor, which it hasn't been able to do in months. Whether that's the SNRI starting to work or just less work stress giving you room to breathe\u2014or both\u2014something cracked open slightly. The fact that you noticed it, that it registered as different, tells me you're paying attention to those small shifts. And making dinner together without it feeling forced? That's real connection happening again, even if it's still fragile. How did it feel afterward\u2014did the lightness stick around, or did it fade pretty quickly?\n\n**Calling your mom back:** She'd left voicemails, you finally picked up. Didn't mention medication, just talked about normal things\u2014work wrapping up, time off. She seemed happy to hear you engaging instead of one-word answers. Not magically close, but less strained. You're answering her calls now instead of letting them pile up.\n\nThat's a quiet repair happening. You're not forcing some big reconciliation or pretending the omega-3 article thing didn't bother you. You're just... showing up for normal conversation, which is what's manageable right now. And she's responding to that\u2014she noticed the difference. Sometimes relationships don't need big breakthroughs, they just need you to pick up the phone. Sounds like you found a sustainable middle ground with her where you're not shutting her out but you're also not giving her access to the parts that feel too vulnerable. That balance makes sense for where you are with her.\n\n**The frustration with your body not cooperating:** You can feel something shifting slightly with the people around me\u2014your partner, your mom\u2014but your body won't cooperate. It's frustrating.\n\nYeah, that disconnect is hard. Your relational world is starting to thaw a bit: easier conversation with your partner, almost laughing, less strained calls with your mom. But your body's still stuck in exhaustion mode, not catching up with the small emotional shifts that are starting to happen. It feels like progress is happening unevenly\u2014some parts of you are moving while others are still frozen.\n\nHere's what might be happening: the SNRI is starting to work on the emotional blunting piece (which would explain the almost-laugh, the less forced time with your partner), but it hasn't fully kicked in yet on the energy and motivation piece. SNRIs can sometimes affect those systems on different timelines. If that's what's going on, the exhaustion might be the last thing to shift as the medication reaches full effect over the next few weeks. That doesn't make it less frustrating to live through, but it would mean you're seeing early signs of the medication working even though it doesn't feel complete yet.\n\nOne thing you could do: mention the almost-laugh moment to your therapist. That's a real data point that something's changing, and it's worth tracking alongside the exhaustion. They should know that emotional responsiveness is starting to come back, even if energy isn't there yet. That gives them a fuller picture of how the SNRI is landing for you.\n\nHow are you planning to spend the rest of the week off?"

      "user": "So the week off is almost over and honestly it's been kind of a blur. Spent most of it just... existing, I guess. Didn't do anything particularly restorative or whatever. Just stayed home, read some, made coffee, that sort of thing. The exhaustion hasn't budged which is annoying but fine. My therapist was right about the timeline.\n\nThe medication thing\u2014I mentioned that almost-laugh moment to them like you suggested. They seemed pleased about it, said it's exactly the kind of early sign they look for. So apparently something is working even if I can't feel it broadly yet. Takes the edge off slightly, knowing there's at least movement happening somewhere.\n\nWork starts up again Monday. My manager has another project lined up but it's different scope\u2014less of the crisis juggling, more focused work. Feels manageable. I'm going back into it less destroyed than I was before so that's something.\n\nBut the relationship thing. My partner brought it up again yesterday, not in a heavy way, just asking where my head was at. And I told them honestly that I still don't know, that the fog's still there but it feels slightly less dense maybe. They asked if I wanted to keep trying or if I thought we should take space. I said I wanted to keep trying. Which I guess means I'm choosing to stay, even if I can't feel much about it yet. They seemed relieved by that, which made me feel like maybe I gave them something they needed to hear.",
      "assistant": "**The week off as a blur:** You spent it existing\u2014staying home, reading, making coffee. Didn't do anything particularly restorative, just moved through the days. Sometimes a week off isn't about doing something transformative. Sometimes it's just about not being in crisis mode for a few days. You gave yourself space even if it felt uneventful, and that's different than jumping straight from one high-pressure project to the next without stopping. The fact that the exhaustion hasn't budged is annoying, but you're tracking it and your therapist's timeline is holding\u2014that recalibration is still happening under the surface.\n\n**The almost-laugh as an early sign:** You mentioned it to your therapist and they seemed pleased, said it's exactly the kind of early signal they look for. So apparently something is working even if you can't feel it broadly yet. That takes the edge off slightly, knowing there's movement happening somewhere.\n\nYeah, that matters. Your therapist isn't just being optimistic\u2014they're tracking concrete evidence that the SNRI is starting to affect emotional responsiveness. The almost-laugh, the less forced time with your partner, those aren't placebo or wishful thinking. They're your brain starting to generate spontaneous emotional reactions again, even if it's still fragile and incomplete. The exhaustion and the fog are still there, but something underneath is shifting. You're in that weird in-between space where progress is happening but it doesn't feel like progress yet because it's so incremental. Trust that your therapist knows what they're looking at here.\n\n**Work Monday, different scope:** Your manager has another project lined up but it's less crisis juggling, more focused work. Feels manageable. You're going back into it less destroyed than before.\n\nThat's real. A few months ago you were drowning in overlapping deadlines, skipping lunch, snapping at your partner. Now you're going into a new project with boundaries already in place, sleep stable, and your nervous system not running on fumes. You're not excited about it\u2014your brain still can't generate that\u2014but you're also not dreading it the way you were before. That's capacity returning, even if it's quiet.\n\n**Your partner asking where your head's at:** They brought it up again yesterday, not heavy, just asking. You told them honestly that you still don't know, that the fog's still there but slightly less dense maybe. They asked if you wanted to keep trying or take space. You said you wanted to keep trying. You're choosing to stay even if you can't feel much about it yet. They seemed relieved, which made you feel like maybe you gave them something they needed to hear.\n\nThis is significant. You didn't have clarity or certainty or a big emotional declaration. But you made a choice anyway: keep trying. That's you orienting toward the relationship even from inside the fog, betting on the possibility that when the fog lifts there will be something worth being in. And your partner heard that\u2014they were relieved. What you gave them wasn't certainty, but it was commitment to the process of figuring it out together instead of bailing while you're still too numb to know what you actually want.\n\nHere's what I'm noticing: a few weeks ago you were asking if the blankness was depression or something real about the relationship. You still don't have a definitive answer to that, but you made a decision to stay and find out. That's you trusting that you can't make the real decision from inside the fog, so you're choosing the option that keeps the door open until you can see more clearly. That's actually a pretty wise move\u2014you're not forcing a conclusion you don't have access to yet, but you're also not abandoning something that might matter once your brain comes back online.\n\nHow's it sitting with you now that you said it out loud to them? Does \"I want to keep trying\" feel true, or does it feel more like \"this is the least-bad option right now\"?"

      "user": "Okay so work started back up Monday like I said. The project's fine, less chaotic than before, and I'm managing it without feeling like everything's about to collapse. That part's actually working.\n\nBut something shifted with the medication maybe. Or maybe it's just been long enough that I'm noticing things differently. I had a moment yesterday where I was sitting with my partner watching something on tv and I actually felt... something. Not big, but like a warmth there. Like they existed and I was aware of them existing and it mattered. First time in months that's happened without trying. It just was there.\n\nAnyway, the exhaustion's finally easing up a bit. Still tired but not the bone-deep thing anymore. Sleep's still solid.\n\nI guess I'm wondering if this is what the medication's supposed to do\u2014just gradually make things feel less impossible instead of some dramatic shift where suddenly I'm fine. Because this doesn't feel like fine, but it also doesn't feel like drowning anymore. It's more like... floating? Is that how it usually goes, or am I missing something.",
      "assistant": "**Work managing without collapse:** The project started Monday, it's less chaotic, and you're handling it without feeling like everything's about to fall apart. That part's actually working. A few months ago you were in survival mode\u2014skipping meals, staying late, wondering what would break. Now you're managing focused work and it feels sustainable. That's not dramatic, but it's real capacity coming back.\n\n**The moment watching tv with your partner:** You were sitting together watching something and you actually felt warmth. Like they existed, you were aware of them existing, and it mattered. First time in months that happened without trying\u2014it just was there.\n\nThat's the fog lifting. Not all at once, but enough that spontaneous connection broke through. You didn't have to work at feeling something or perform engagement. Your brain just generated a moment of warmth toward them, unprompted. That's what emotional responsiveness coming back looks like\u2014it's quiet, it's a flicker, but it's real. And it happened on its own, which matters. You're not manufacturing feelings anymore. They're starting to show up again. How did that moment land for you\u2014did it feel familiar, like \"oh, this is what it used to be like,\" or did it feel new somehow?\n\n**Exhaustion finally easing:** Still tired, but not the bone-deep thing anymore. Sleep's still solid. So that recalibration your therapist talked about is resolving\u2014your body's adjusting to the SNRI and the physical heaviness is starting to lift. That timeline they gave you is tracking. You're a few weeks in now and the pieces are starting to come together: emotional responsiveness returning, exhaustion easing, sleep stable. Those are all signs the medication is doing what it's supposed to.\n\n**Is this what it's supposed to do\u2014gradual instead of dramatic:** You're wondering if the medication is supposed to just gradually make things feel less impossible instead of some dramatic shift where suddenly you're fine. Because this doesn't feel like fine, but it also doesn't feel like drowning anymore. More like floating.\n\nYeah, this is exactly how it usually goes. The movies and the commercials show someone taking a pill and suddenly everything's bright and they're running through fields or whatever. That's not real. What's real is what you're describing: things stop feeling impossible. The weight lifts incrementally. You have a moment of warmth with your partner that you didn't have to force. You wake up tired instead of bone-tired. You manage work without feeling like you're about to collapse. None of that is \"fine,\" but it's also not drowning. Floating is actually the perfect word for it.\n\nWhat happens next\u2014if the medication keeps working the way it seems to be\u2014is that floating gradually becomes standing. The flickers of warmth become more frequent and last longer. The exhaustion keeps easing until you wake up and don't think about being tired first thing. The fog thins enough that you can see what you actually want instead of just blankness. But it's incremental, and it doesn't usually feel dramatic while it's happening. You just notice one day that you laughed without thinking about it, or that you made plans for next week and felt curious about them, or that you looked at your partner and wanted to be close to them again.\n\nYou're not missing something. This is it. This is recovery starting to happen. It's subtle and it's slow and it doesn't feel like enough yet, but you're not in the same place you were a month ago. The almost-laugh turned into a moment of warmth. The bone-deep exhaustion is easing. Work feels manageable. Those are all real movements, even if they don't add up to \"fine\" yet.\n\nKeep tracking this with your therapist. They should know about the warmth moment and the exhaustion easing\u2014that's evidence the SNRI is landing. And keep noticing the small shifts as they happen. You don't have to feel grateful or optimistic or any particular way about them. Just notice them. That's enough for now."
