      "user": "work's been a mess. got pulled into this legal thing with a client that's way outside what i signed up for. my manager keeps saying \"just handle it\" but like... i don't have the background for this and frankly i'm not sure it's even my job. \n\nplus i realized i haven't hung out with anyone in like three weeks. usually i don't mind solo time but this feels different. quieter. my friend jason texted last week and i just... didn't respond. not mad at him or anything, just felt like too much energy.\n\nanyway. how do i even start untangling the work stuff.",
      "assistant": "**The legal thing at work:**\n\n\"Just handle it\" when you don't have the background and aren't sure it's your job\u2014that's not guidance, that's avoidance. Sounds like your manager is dumping something unclear on you and hoping you'll figure it out. Two things might help: First, what *exactly* are you being asked to do? Sometimes when we feel overwhelmed, the task itself gets fuzzy. If you can name the specific actions expected, you can figure out whether it's genuinely outside your scope or just unfamiliar. Second, if it really is beyond your role\u2014what happens if you say \"I need help understanding what success looks like here, and whether this falls under my responsibilities\"? Not refusing, just clarifying. What stops you from asking that?\n\n**The isolation thing:**\n\nThree weeks without seeing anyone, and Jason's text sitting there unanswered\u2014it's not that you're avoiding him specifically, it's that responding feels like effort you don't have. That shift from \"I enjoy solo time\" to \"this feels quieter\" is worth noticing. Sometimes when work is draining, social energy is the first thing to go. But sometimes it's the other way around\u2014isolation makes work feel heavier because there's nothing balancing it out. Which direction does it feel like for you? And what would \"just enough\" connection look like right now\u2014not a full hangout, but something smaller?"

      "user": "ugh. so i did try to ask my manager for clarity on the legal thing. he just said \"it's client relations, figure out what they need\" which is... not helpful. turns out the client wants me to review some contract stuff and give them legal advice basically. i'm not a lawyer. told my manager that and he was like \"you know contracts better than anyone here\" which is true but that's not the same thing.\n\nbeen stewing on it since yesterday. don't want to just quit over this but also don't want to get the company sued because i misstepped on something legal.\n\nanyway jason finally got back to me this morning. said he was worried because i've been distant. made me feel kind of bad honestly. told him maybe we could grab coffee next week but like... i don't know if i actually want to or if i'm just saying it to not disappoint him. weird feeling.",
      "assistant": "**The legal advice boundary:**\n\nYour manager saying \"you know contracts better than anyone\" is him conflating familiarity with qualification\u2014and that's dangerous for you. You're right to be worried about liability. Here's the thing: if the client is asking for *legal advice* (interpreting contract terms, assessing risk, advising on enforceability), that's practicing law without a license in most places. \"Knowing contracts\" doesn't make that safe or appropriate. \n\nOne option: go back to your manager with specifics. \"Client is asking me to [exact thing they're asking]. That's legal advice. If I do that and I'm wrong, the company is exposed. Do we have in-house counsel who should handle this, or can we engage outside counsel?\" That's not refusing work\u2014it's protecting the company. What do you think would happen if you framed it that way? And if he still says \"just handle it,\" what's your next move\u2014escalate to HR, document the conversation, something else?\n\n**Jason reaching out:**\n\nHe said he's worried because you've been distant, and that made you feel bad. That guilt\u2014\"I should want to see him, so why don't I?\"\u2014is worth sitting with for a second. Sometimes we agree to plans because disappointing someone feels worse than forcing ourselves to show up. But then you spend the whole coffee mentally elsewhere, which isn't great for either of you. What if you checked in with yourself: when you imagine grabbing coffee with Jason next week, what comes up? Relief? Dread? Neutral obligation? That feeling might tell you whether \"maybe next week\" is genuine or just guilt management."

      "user": "ok so i talked to my manager again about the legal thing. basically told him what you said about liability and he got defensive. said \"you're overthinking this, clients ask for advice all the time.\" which like... maybe? but it still doesn't feel right. didn't push back more because honestly i was tired and didn't want to deal with the conflict. he moved on to other stuff and i just let it drop.\n\nfeeling kinda stuck now. part of me wants to just email someone in the legal department and be like \"hey heads up\" but that feels like going around him and i don't want to create drama.\n\non the jason thing though\u2014we're grabbing coffee tomorrow. i said yes and then immediately regretted it but whatever, already committed. been thinking about what you said about checking in with myself and honestly? when i think about seeing him it's mostly just... tired. like the idea of talking and being present feels exhausting. which is weird because jason's one of the few people i actually like.\n\nanyway work is still a nightmare. they want the contract review done by end of week. feels impossible right now.",
      "assistant": "**The legal boundary (and what \"stuck\" actually means):**\n\nHe said \"you're overthinking this\" and you dropped it because you were tired and didn't want conflict. That's not overthinking\u2014that's your gut saying \"this could go badly\" and him dismissing it because acknowledging the risk would mean he'd have to do something. You're not stuck because the situation is impossible. You're stuck because your options all feel bad: do the thing and risk liability, refuse and deal with his defensiveness, or loop in legal and risk seeming like you're going around him.\n\nHere's what I'm noticing: you're treating \"not creating drama\" as more important than protecting yourself. What if the drama is already here\u2014he's asked you to do something legally risky, dismissed your concern, and left you holding the bag? Going to legal isn't creating a problem, it's naming one that already exists. One way to frame it: \"Hey, [manager] asked me to review contract terms for [client]. I want to make sure I'm not stepping into legal advice territory. Can you clarify what I can and can't say to clients about contracts?\" That's not tattling, that's doing your job carefully. What feels harder about that than just doing the contract review and hoping nothing blows up?\n\n**Coffee with Jason tomorrow:**\n\nYou said yes, regretted it immediately, and when you think about seeing him the main feeling is \"tired.\" Not angry, not annoyed\u2014just exhausted at the idea of being present. That's not about Jason. That's about you running on empty and not having the energy to show up for anyone, even people you genuinely like.\n\nHere's the thing: you can still change your mind. \"Hey, I need to reschedule\u2014work has been brutal and I'm not going to be good company. Can we do this in a couple weeks when I'm less fried?\" That's not flaking, that's being honest. But if you do go, notice what happens. Does being around him drain you more, or does it actually help? Sometimes when we're isolated and depleted, we think connection will make it worse, but the opposite turns out to be true. Either way, you'll learn something about what you need right now.\n\n**The deadline:**\n\nContract review due end of week, feels impossible. Is it actually impossible (not enough hours, missing information), or does it feel impossible because you're dreading it and don't want to do it? If it's the former, what would make it doable\u2014extension, help from someone else, clearer scope? If it's the latter, what's one small piece you could knock out today just to prove to yourself it's not as stuck as it feels?"

      "assistant": "**Cancelling on Jason:**\n\nYou cancelled and you hate that you did it\u2014but look at what actually happened: you told him you were swamped, he seemed cool about it, and now you're the one carrying the guilt. Jason's not mad. You are. That gap between \"he's fine\" and \"I feel terrible\" is worth noticing. What's the story you're telling yourself about what it means that you bailed? Because from here, it sounds like you made a call based on your actual capacity (you're fried, work is a nightmare), and he understood. But you're treating it like you failed him somehow. What would it look like to take him at his word\u2014that he gets it and it's okay?\n\n**The contract review (and the pattern underneath it):**\n\nYou did part of the review even though you hate it, got through two sections, brain fried. Your manager's pinging you for updates. You didn't email legal because you kept thinking about how it would look. And now you're stuck because \"every option sucks so I'm just not picking any of them and hoping it goes away.\"\n\nHere's what I'm seeing: you're not stuck because the options are all bad. You're stuck because you're trying to avoid all discomfort at once\u2014don't piss off your manager, don't look like you're going around him, don't risk the liability, don't disappoint the client, don't create drama. That's an impossible puzzle. Something has to give. Right now, what's giving is *you*\u2014you're doing work you think is risky, you're fried, and you're hoping it resolves itself. That's not cowardice, that's just what happens when all the options feel like conflict and you're already running on empty.\n\nOne question: what's the worst thing that actually happens if you email legal? Not the story your brain tells about how your manager will react\u2014the actual concrete consequence. He finds out, he's annoyed, and then what? Compare that to the worst thing that happens if you finish this contract review, the client acts on your advice, and it turns out you were wrong. Which risk are you actually more willing to live with?\n\n**The hoping-it-goes-away thing:**\n\nYou already know that won't work. So what's one move you can make that doesn't require you to solve the whole thing at once? Could be: finish one more section of the review and see if you can live with that. Could be: draft the email to legal and sit on it for a day. Could be: tell your manager \"I can get you a partial draft by Friday, but I need clarity on [specific question] before I can finish.\" You don't have to fix everything today. But doing nothing is its own choice, and it sounds like that one's making you feel worse. What's the smallest thing you could do that would feel like forward motion instead of paralysis?"

      "user": "so i did email legal. just sent it this morning before i could talk myself out of it again. kept it simple\u2014said client is asking for contract interpretation and i wanted to make sure i wasn't overstepping. didn't mention my manager at all, just framed it as \"want to check the boundaries.\"\n\nhaven't heard back yet but honestly? feels better already. like i did the thing instead of just sitting in it.\n\nmy manager pinged me about the review status and i told him i'm waiting on clarification from legal before i finish the sections. he seemed annoyed but didn't push back hard. not sure if that's because he knows why i looped them in or if he just moved on. either way it's off my shoulders for now.\n\nthe jason thing is still bugging me though. he texted again asking if we could reschedule for next week and i said yeah but... i don't know. part of me feels like i owe him better than this flaky back-and-forth. like he's being patient and i'm just ghosting him basically. but also the idea of committing to plans still feels like this weight. even knowing he's cool about it.\n\nwork feels slightly less crushing now that legal is involved. but also like... waiting to hear from them is its own kind of stress. what if they say \"yeah that's fine, give them advice\"? then i'm back where i started.",
      "assistant": "**You emailed legal:**\n\nYou sent it before you could talk yourself out of it, kept it simple, didn't throw your manager under the bus\u2014and now it feels better because you actually did the thing instead of sitting in the dread. That shift from \"paralyzed by all the bad options\" to \"I picked one and moved forward\" is huge. You broke the loop. And when your manager pinged you, you had an answer that wasn't defensive or apologetic\u2014just \"waiting on clarification from legal.\" He was annoyed but didn't push back hard, which tells you something: either he knows he put you in a weird spot, or he's not as invested in this as your anxiety made it seem. Either way, you protected yourself without creating the drama you were afraid of. That took guts.\n\nNow you're in the waiting part, which has its own stress\u2014\"what if they say it's fine and I'm back where I started?\" Here's the thing: even if legal says \"yeah, you can give general guidance,\" you'll have clarity on *what* you can say and *where the line is*. That's not the same as being handed an impossible task with no support. And if they say \"no, this needs to go through us,\" you've just solved the problem entirely. You didn't create this situation by asking for help. You inherited a messy handoff from your manager and you're handling it carefully. That's the right move.\n\n**The Jason thing:**\n\nHe asked to reschedule for next week, you said yeah, and now you're back in the same loop\u2014feels like a weight, feels like you owe him better, feels flaky. But here's what I'm noticing: you're treating \"being uncertain whether you want to hang out\" as a moral failing. It's not. You're allowed to not know if you have the energy for social plans while you're in the middle of a work crisis. That doesn't make you a bad friend. It makes you someone whose capacity is currently maxed out.\n\nThe \"ghosting him basically\" framing is harsh. Ghosting is disappearing without explanation. You've been clear that work is overwhelming, you've rescheduled instead of bailing entirely, and he's been patient because he gets it. He's not sitting around feeling abandoned\u2014you're sitting around feeling guilty for not being available the way you think you should be. What if you took the pressure off yourself and just said: \"Hey, I want to see you but I'm genuinely not sure when I'll have bandwidth. Can I reach out when work calms down instead of committing to next week and risking another reschedule?\" That's not flaky. That's honest. And it gives you room to breathe instead of white-knuckling your way through plans you're dreading.\n\nOne other thing: you said \"the idea of committing to plans still feels like this weight.\" What if the weight isn't the plans themselves\u2014it's the fact that everything right now feels like another obligation on a list you can't finish? When work is crushing you, even good things start to feel like tasks. That might ease up once the legal thing resolves and you're not carrying that constant dread. Worth seeing if the \"too much energy\" feeling shifts when the work stress does."

      "user": "quick update. legal got back to me yesterday. said client stuff needs to go through proper channels, i can't do it. basically killed the whole thing. my manager hasn't said anything yet which is either good or means he's mad and waiting. idk.\n\nanyway that's not even the main thing on my mind right now. jason came over last night. i didn't reschedule again, just... let it happen. and honestly it was fine? we just sat around, didn't do much. he made coffee, we talked about some work stuff, his new place. nothing heavy. and like, it didn't drain me the way i thought it would. actually felt kind of good to just be around someone.\n\nbut then this morning i'm back to feeling isolated again. like that one good night doesn't change the fact that i've basically been checked out from everyone for weeks. and now i'm thinking maybe the problem isn't jason or coffee plans. maybe the problem is just me. like i'm the one who goes quiet when things get hard and then wonders why nobody's around.\n\nwork's lighter now that legal's handling the client thing but also feel kind of hollow about it? like i fixed the immediate problem but i'm still just... stuck in the same patterns. does that make sense.",
      "assistant": "**Legal came through:**\n\nThey said it has to go through proper channels, you can't do it\u2014which is exactly what your gut was telling you from the start. You protected yourself by asking, and now the boundary is clear. Your manager hasn't said anything yet, and you're reading that silence as either \"good\" or \"he's mad and waiting.\" Here's another option: he knows he put you in a position that didn't hold up under scrutiny, and there's nothing for him to say. You didn't create a problem by looping in legal\u2014you surfaced one that was already there. If he's frustrated, that's about him having to deal with it properly now, not about you doing anything wrong.\n\n**Jason came over:**\n\nYou let it happen instead of rescheduling again, and it was fine. You just sat around, nothing heavy, and it didn't drain you the way you thought it would\u2014actually felt kind of good. That gap between what you expected (exhausting, too much) and what actually happened (fine, even good) is important. Sometimes when we're running on empty, we assume *everything* will cost more than we have. But being around Jason didn't take energy\u2014it gave you some. That's worth noticing.\n\n**The \"maybe the problem is just me\" thing:**\n\nThis morning you're back to feeling isolated, and now you're wondering if the problem isn't the plans or Jason\u2014it's that you go quiet when things get hard and then wonder why nobody's around. That's a painful thought, and there's some truth in it. You *do* pull back when you're overwhelmed. But \"the problem is just me\" flattens something more complicated. You didn't ghost people because you're broken or defective. You pulled back because work was crushing you, you were carrying a risky situation your manager dumped on you, and you didn't have energy left over for anyone else. That's not a character flaw. That's what happens when you're in survival mode.\n\nThe pattern you're noticing\u2014\"I go quiet when things get hard\"\u2014is real. But it's not the whole story. When things got hard, you also asked for help (legal), you protected yourself (didn't just do the risky contract work), and you eventually showed up for Jason even though you were dreading it. You didn't just disappear. You pulled back temporarily because you had to, and then you came back. That's not the same as \"the problem is me.\"\n\nOne thing that might help: when you notice yourself starting to pull back, what if you named it out loud to the person? Not as an apology, just as information. \"Hey, work is brutal right now and I'm pretty checked out from everyone\u2014it's not about you, I just don't have much bandwidth.\" That way people like Jason know what's happening instead of interpreting your silence as distance. And it takes some of the weight off you because you're not carrying the guilt of \"I should be better at this.\" You're just being honest about where you're at.\n\n**The hollow feeling:**\n\nWork's lighter now that legal is handling the client thing, but you feel hollow about it. You fixed the immediate problem but you're still stuck in the same patterns. That makes sense. Solving one crisis doesn't undo the fact that your manager put you in that position in the first place, or that this probably isn't the last time something like this will happen. The relief of \"that problem is gone\" is real, but it's sitting next to the awareness that the system that created it is still there. What would it look like to address that\u2014not the individual fire, but the pattern of fires? Is this a \"I need to have a bigger conversation with my manager about boundaries\" thing, or a \"this job isn't set up in a way that works for me\" thing?"

      "assistant": "**Your manager's response:**\n\n\"That's the kind of thing we handle internally\"\u2014which apparently means you doing something risky without support and him being annoyed when you protect yourself. He's reframing your reasonable boundary as overstepping, and you didn't argue because... what's the point? He's already shown he's not interested in hearing your concern. That \"just kind of nodded and moved on\" isn't weakness\u2014it's you recognizing that pushing back won't change anything and choosing not to waste energy on a fight you can't win. But I'm curious: what did it cost you to let that sit there unchallenged? Sometimes \"not arguing\" feels like the practical move in the moment, but it leaves residue\u2014resentment, frustration, the sense that you can't actually speak up in this job. Is that building up, or did it genuinely just roll off?\n\n**The isolation pattern (still happening even though the crisis is over):**\n\nYou thought once the work crisis cleared, the withdrawal would resolve itself. But it's been five days since Jason came over and you haven't reached out. Your sister called Tuesday, you let it go to voicemail, didn't call back. And the weird part is you can see the pattern happening in real time\u2014you're aware you're doing it\u2014and you're still letting it happen. That's not weird. That's actually really common. The crisis gave you a reason to pull back (\"I'm too overwhelmed to connect\"), and now that the crisis is mostly done, you don't have that excuse anymore\u2014but the withdrawal is still there. Which means it wasn't just about work being hard. It was about something deeper.\n\nHere's one possibility: when you're in survival mode, pulling back is functional. It protects your energy, it keeps you from overextending. But sometimes the habit of pulling back outlasts the thing that triggered it. You spent weeks in that mode\u2014work crushing you, manager putting you in impossible spots, everything feeling like too much. Your nervous system learned \"connection = more demand = can't handle it.\" Even though the acute crisis is over, that wiring is still there. Reaching out to Jason or calling your sister back might *objectively* be fine now, but it doesn't *feel* fine yet. Your body's still in protection mode.\n\nThe other possibility: maybe the work crisis wasn't the whole picture. Maybe you've been running on empty for longer than just these few weeks, and the legal thing was just the most recent breaking point. If that's true, then solving one problem wouldn't magically restore your capacity for connection. You'd still be depleted. Does that resonate, or does it feel like I'm overreading it?\n\n**Naming it out loud feels vulnerable:**\n\nYou said telling Jason \"hey I'm checked out\" feels like admitting something's wrong with you instead of just not being available for a bit. I get that. There's a difference between \"I'm busy\" (external, temporary, neutral) and \"I'm checked out\" (internal, about you, feels like a confession). But here's the thing: Jason already knows something's up. You cancelled on him, rescheduled, he said he was worried you've been distant. He's not interpreting your silence as \"oh he's just busy\"\u2014he's interpreting it as *something*, and without information from you, he's filling in the blank himself. Maybe he thinks you're mad at him. Maybe he thinks he did something wrong. Maybe he's just confused. Naming it out loud doesn't create vulnerability that wasn't already there\u2014it just gives him accurate information instead of leaving him guessing.\n\nAnd here's the other part: \"something's wrong with me\" vs. \"I'm not available for a bit\" is a false binary. What if it's neither? What if it's just \"I've been running on empty and I'm still trying to refill, so I'm not reaching out much right now\"? That's not a character flaw. That's just where you're at. You don't owe anyone a performance of being fine when you're not. But you also don't have to frame it as \"I'm broken\"\u2014you can just name the reality. \"Hey, work's been brutal and I'm still kind of in recovery mode. Not ignoring you, just low bandwidth.\" That's honest without being self-blaming. What feels hard about that version?\n\n**One small thing to try:**\n\nYou're seeing the pattern in real time and letting it happen. What if instead of trying to fix the whole thing at once, you just interrupted it once? Not a big gesture\u2014just text Jason one sentence. \"Hey, been quiet this week. How's it going?\" See what happens. It doesn't have to mean you're committing to plans or forcing yourself into connection you don't have energy for. It's just a signal that you're still here, still thinking of him, even if you're not fully back yet. Sometimes breaking the pattern doesn't require solving why it's happening\u2014just doing one thing different and seeing if that shifts anything."

      "assistant": "**Texting Jason:**\n\nYou kept it simple, he responded quick, asked about lunch tomorrow, and you said yeah without overthinking it. That's momentum\u2014you interrupted the pattern, he met you there, and now you've got plans that don't feel weighted down by guilt or dread. That's different from the last few times. Notice that.\n\n**The manager thing sitting with you:**\n\nYou couldn't sleep last night because you kept thinking about how you just nodded and moved on when he said you overstepped. The more you sat with it, the more it pissed you off\u2014he told you that you were wrong for protecting the company from legal liability, and you just accepted it. This morning you were going to email him and explain your side, but then you realized something bigger: you don't actually want to work there anymore. Not because of this one thing, but because the whole dynamic is broken. He puts you in bad spots, blames you for not handling them perfectly, and you're supposed to be cool with that.\n\nThat realization\u2014\"I don't want to work there anymore\"\u2014didn't come out of nowhere. It came from weeks of this pattern: the legal thing, the \"just handle it\" non-answers, the defensiveness when you asked for clarity, and now the reframe where *you're* the problem for escalating appropriately. You've been trying to make it work by managing each crisis individually, but the crisis factory is still running. And now you can see it clearly: this isn't a problem you can solve by being better at your job or communicating more carefully. The system itself doesn't work for you.\n\nHere's what I'm noticing: you went from \"I was going to email him and explain my side\" to \"I don't actually want to work there anymore\" really fast. That's not overthinking or catastrophizing\u2014that's clarity breaking through. The email would've been you trying to fix the unfixable, trying to get him to see your side when he's already shown he won't. Realizing you don't want to be there anymore is you finally listening to what your gut's been saying for a while. The question isn't whether that's true\u2014it sounds like it is. The question is what you do with that information when you can't act on it immediately.\n\n**The \"stuck again but in a bigger way\" feeling:**\n\nYou can't just quit because rent's due next month and you don't have anything lined up. So now you're stuck in a different way\u2014you know you want out, but you can't leave yet, which means you have to keep showing up to a job that's eroding you while you figure out the next move. That's legitimately hard. It's one thing to tolerate a bad situation when you think it might get better. It's another thing entirely to tolerate it when you know you're on your way out but the exit isn't available yet.\n\nOne thing that might help: there's a difference between \"stuck and waiting for rescue\" and \"stuck but actively building the exit.\" Right now you're in the second one, even if it doesn't feel like it yet. You can't quit today, but you can start doing the things that make quitting possible in two months, three months, whatever the timeline is. Update your resume. Reach out to your network. Look at what's out there. Apply to a few places just to see what happens. That doesn't commit you to anything, but it shifts you from \"trapped and helpless\" to \"temporarily stuck but working the problem.\" Does that feel doable, or is even that too much right now given everything else?\n\n**The question underneath all of this:**\n\nWhat were you hoping the email to your manager would accomplish? Because if it was \"I want him to understand my side and acknowledge I did the right thing,\" I don't think that's available. He's already decided you overstepped, and explaining won't change that\u2014it'll just give him another chance to defend his position. But if it was \"I need to say this out loud so it's not just sitting in my chest,\" that's different. You don't have to send the email to get that. You could write it and not send it. Or you could say it here. What did you want him to hear?"

      "user": "lunch with jason was actually good. we talked about his new place, my work stuff came up and he asked what was going on. didn't give him the whole thing but told him it's been rough and i'm probably gonna look for something else. he was supportive about it which... i don't know, felt nice? like he actually gives a shit instead of just being polite.\n\nbut then today at work everything felt different. like now that i know i want out, sitting at my desk feels surreal. manager asked me to do some analysis on a client proposal and i just... did it. no pushback, no stress about it. which is weird because usually that stuff annoys me. but it's like, i don't care anymore? not in a bad way, just like it doesn't matter what i do there now. already halfway out the door mentally.\n\nexcept then i got home and that feeling flipped. started thinking about the actual logistics of leaving. like how long can i realistically last on savings if i don't find something right away. whether i should stay longer to be safe. and now i'm second-guessing the whole \"i don't want to work there\" thing. like maybe i'm overreacting because of the manager thing. maybe the job's fine and i'm just being dramatic.\n\nalso my sister texted again asking if we could catch up this weekend. said yes but i'm already kind of dreading it? which is stupid because a week ago i was worried i'd lost my ability to connect with people and now that people are actually reaching out i'm... pulling back again. it's like i can see myself doing it but can't stop it.",
      "assistant": "**Lunch with Jason:**\n\nHe asked what was going on, you told him it's been rough and you're probably gonna look for something else, and he was supportive in a way that felt real\u2014like he actually gives a shit, not just being polite. That distinction matters. You've been worried about losing connection with people, and here's Jason showing up exactly how you needed him to. He didn't push for details, didn't try to fix it, just listened and cared. That's the kind of thing that's easy to brush past when you're in your head about everything else, but it's worth letting it land: you reached out, he met you there, and it felt good. That's not nothing.\n\n**The surreal detachment at work:**\n\nManager asked you to do client analysis and you just... did it. No pushback, no stress, no annoyance. You said it's like you don't care anymore\u2014not in a bad way, just that it doesn't matter what you do there now because you're already halfway out the door mentally. That detachment you're describing? That's what happens when you stop trying to make something work that fundamentally doesn't fit. For weeks you were carrying the weight of \"how do I fix this, how do I protect myself, how do I manage my manager's expectations\"\u2014and all of that required caring deeply about the outcome. Now that you've landed on \"I don't want to be here,\" the stakes dropped. It's not your long-term problem to solve anymore, it's just a thing you're doing temporarily while you figure out the exit. That's why the analysis didn't bother you. You're not invested in making this job work anymore, so the day-to-day friction just... dissolved.\n\n**The logistics panic and the second-guessing:**\n\nThen you got home and the feeling flipped. Started thinking about how long savings will last, whether you should stay longer to be safe, whether you're overreacting and the job's actually fine. That whiplash\u2014from \"I don't care, I'm already gone\" to \"wait, maybe I'm being dramatic\"\u2014makes complete sense. At work, when you're in it, the detachment feels like relief. At home, when you're facing the actual consequences of leaving (financial uncertainty, no backup plan), your brain goes into threat mode and starts questioning whether the problem is even real. \"Maybe the job's fine\" is your mind trying to avoid the scarier thing, which is stepping into the unknown without a safety net.\n\nHere's the thing: you're not overreacting because of one bad interaction with your manager. The manager thing was the breaking point, but the pattern underneath it\u2014him putting you in bad spots, dismissing your concerns, blaming you for protecting yourself\u2014that's been there the whole time. The legal thing just made it impossible to ignore. And the fact that you feel detached and surreal at work now? That's not you being dramatic. That's your nervous system telling you that you've already started to disengage because staying fully present in that environment costs too much.\n\nThe question isn't \"is the job actually fine or am I overreacting?\" The question is: \"Can I tolerate staying here for however long it takes to line something else up?\" Because leaving without a plan is legitimately risky\u2014rent's due, savings run out, job searches take time. But staying in a place that's eroding you also has a cost, even if it's slower and harder to measure. You don't have to decide today whether to quit tomorrow. You just have to decide what the next small move is. Update resume? Reach out to one person in your network? Set a timeline for how long you're willing to stay before you'd leave even without something lined up? What feels like the smallest version of forward motion that doesn't require you to solve the whole thing at once?\n\n**Your sister this weekend:**\n\nShe texted asking to catch up, you said yes, and now you're already dreading it. You said it's stupid because a week ago you were worried you'd lost your ability to connect, and now that people are reaching out you're pulling back again. You can see yourself doing it but can't stop it. That's not stupid\u2014that's you recognizing the pattern clearly but not yet having the tools to interrupt it in the moment. Here's what might be happening: saying yes to your sister felt like the right move when you were thinking about it abstractly (\"I should connect with people, I've been too isolated\"). But now that it's real and on the calendar, it's activating the same \"this will cost energy I don't have\" response that's been running in the background for weeks. Your capacity is still low\u2014work is still draining you, you're carrying the weight of a big life decision about leaving, and your nervous system hasn't fully recovered from the crisis mode you were in before.\n\nOne thing to try: when you're with your sister this weekend, notice what actually happens instead of what you predicted would happen. With Jason, you dreaded it and then it was fine\u2014actually good. Maybe the same thing happens with your sister. Or maybe it doesn't, and being around her really does drain you, and that tells you something about what kind of connection feels manageable right now versus what doesn't. Either way, you're gathering data instead of just white-knuckling through obligations. And if you get there and you're genuinely not up for it, you can leave early. \"Hey, I'm more fried than I thought\u2014can we cut this short and pick it up another time?\" That's not failing. That's listening to yourself and adjusting instead of forcing it."

      "assistant": "**Time with your sister:**\n\nIt went way better than expected\u2014you hung out, she made food, you talked, and it felt normal in a way that reminded you why you like being around her. That gap between \"I'm dreading this\" and \"oh, this is actually good\" keeps happening (Jason, now your sister), and every time it does, it's your brain learning something new: connection doesn't always cost what you think it will. Sometimes it gives back instead of taking. Worth noticing that the dread is consistent but the reality keeps being different.\n\n**Venting to her about your manager:**\n\nHalfway through telling her the legal situation, you realized you were venting in a way you haven't vented to anyone\u2014and it all came pouring out. How he keeps putting you in impossible spots, how he dismissed you when you asked for help, all of it. And once you said it out loud to another person, it hit different. It's one thing to know it in your head, but saying it to your sister made it real somehow.\n\nThat's not just catharsis\u2014that's what happens when you stop managing the story alone. You've been carrying this situation privately, trying to figure out if it's bad enough to leave, whether you're overreacting, if maybe you can make it work. But when you said it out loud to someone who cares about you and isn't inside the system, you heard it the way she heard it: this is not a small problem, this is not you being dramatic, this is a pattern that's harming you. Her saying \"you should leave that job\" wasn't new information. But it was confirmation from outside your own head that what you're seeing is real. That validation isn't weak\u2014it's clarifying. You needed to hear that you're not making this up.\n\n**The second-guessing versus the certainty:**\n\nYou said you already know you should leave, but hearing someone else say it made you realize you've been going back and forth for days *like* you're not sure, when actually you are sure. You're just second-guessing yourself because of the money stuff. That distinction is everything. The uncertainty isn't about whether you want to leave\u2014it's about whether you *can* leave safely. Those are two different questions, and conflating them is what's keeping you stuck in the loop. You're sure you don't want to be there. You're unsure about the logistics of getting out. Once you separate those, the path forward gets clearer: the decision is already made, now you're just solving for execution.\n\n**Her offer to stay with her:**\n\nShe asked if you want to stay with her for a bit while you figure things out, and your immediate reaction is \"that feels like admitting defeat.\" Like if you move in with your sister, you're basically saying you failed at managing your life. You already know logically that's not how it works, but the feeling is still there\u2014that accepting help means you couldn't handle it on your own, and that's failure.\n\nHere's what I'm noticing: you just spent weeks navigating an impossible work situation, protecting yourself legally when your manager wouldn't, realizing a job isn't working and deciding to leave even though it's financially scary, reconnecting with Jason and your sister after isolating for weeks, and now someone who cares about you is offering material support to make the transition easier. That's not failure. That's you handling a hard situation by using every resource available, including the people who want to help you. \"Managing your life\" doesn't mean doing it alone and refusing support when it's offered\u2014it means recognizing when you need help and letting people show up for you. Your sister isn't offering because she thinks you failed. She's offering because she sees you're in a tough spot and she has the means to make it less tough. That's what people do when they care about each other.\n\nOne question: what would change if you reframed it from \"admitting defeat\" to \"buying myself time and breathing room to make a good next move instead of a desperate one\"? Because that's what her offer actually does. It takes the financial pressure down a notch, which means you're not making decisions from panic\u2014you're making them from a place where you have a little more space. That's strategic, not defeated. What feels hard about accepting that?"

      "user": "ugh. so i talked to my sister more about staying with her and told her yeah, i'd take her up on it. feels weird saying that out loud but also kind of relieving? like one less thing to figure out on my own. we're thinking maybe end of next month, gives me time to line something up or at least get my ducks in a row a bit.\n\nbeen thinking about what you said about the decision being made and now it's just about execution. that actually helped. like, i'm not second-guessing whether to leave anymore, i'm just figuring out the how. updated my resume yesterday, didn't even feel like a big deal once i started. also reached out to a couple people from old jobs who might know about openings. felt good to do something instead of just sitting in it.\n\nbut here's the thing that's been bugging me. at work it's still this weird detached feeling. like i'm going through the motions, doing what's asked, but i'm not really... present? and my manager asked me to help with this big proposal thing and i just said sure, even though part of me wanted to say no. which is fine, whatever, but then i got home and realized i just agreed to like six weeks of work on something i'm leaving anyway. so now i'm stuck working on this proposal for a job i'm already checked out of, and it feels kind of pointless.\n\nwhy did i say yes when i could have just said no? like i've been standing up for myself more with the legal stuff but then i turn around and commit to something that doesn't matter. it's like i can do the big brave thing but when it comes to just... basic stuff, i still default to agreeing instead of pushing back. anyway, it's whatever. i'll get through it.",
      "assistant": "**Accepting your sister's offer:**\n\nYou told her yeah, you'd take her up on it\u2014end of next month, gives you time to line things up or at least get your ducks in a row. It feels weird saying it out loud but also relieving, like one less thing to figure out on your own. That relief is the signal. You just took a massive stressor (how do I afford to leave without a safety net) and turned it into a concrete plan with a timeline. That's not small. And the \"weird\" feeling makes sense\u2014accepting help when you're used to white-knuckling through everything alone takes adjustment. But relief is your body telling you this was the right call.\n\n**Resume updated, reaching out to old contacts:**\n\nOnce you separated \"do I want to leave\" (already decided) from \"how do I execute the leaving\" (the actual problem to solve), the resume didn't feel like a big deal once you started. You also reached out to a couple people from old jobs who might know about openings. That shift from \"stuck and hoping it resolves itself\" to \"actively working the problem\" is huge. You're not just waiting for rescue or marinating in dread anymore\u2014you're building the exit. That's momentum.\n\n**The proposal thing (and why you said yes when you wanted to say no):**\n\nManager asked you to help with a big proposal, you said sure even though part of you wanted to say no. Got home, realized you just committed to six weeks of work on something you're leaving anyway, and now you're stuck working on a proposal for a job you're already checked out of. It feels pointless. And the frustrating part is you can see the contradiction: you stood up for yourself with the legal stuff (big brave thing), but when it comes to basic boundary-setting like \"no, I can't take on a six-week project right now,\" you still default to agreeing. \n\nHere's what I'm noticing: the legal thing had clear stakes. If you did it and got it wrong, the company could be liable, you could be liable, it was objectively risky. That made the boundary easy to defend\u2014you had a reason that felt legitimate outside yourself. But saying no to the proposal? That's a boundary where the only reason is \"I don't want to\" or \"this doesn't serve me anymore.\" There's no external justification, no clear harm you're preventing. It's just you deciding your time and energy matter more than your manager's ask. And that's harder, because it requires you to believe that *your preference alone* is reason enough. Which you don't quite believe yet, or you wouldn't have said yes.\n\nThe other thing: you're already halfway out the door mentally, so part of you might be thinking \"what's the point of creating conflict now when I'm leaving soon anyway?\" Like, why make waves over a proposal when you're gone in a few months? But here's the cost of that logic: you just signed yourself up for six weeks of work that feels meaningless, which means six more weeks of showing up to a place that's been eroding you and doing something you don't care about. That's not nothing. That's a significant chunk of time and energy you just handed over because saying no felt harder in the moment than saying yes.\n\n**One thing to try before it's too late:**\n\nYou already said yes, but that doesn't mean you're locked in. You could go back to your manager tomorrow and say, \"Hey, I thought about the proposal and I need to pull back. I've got a lot on my plate and I can't commit to six weeks on this right now. Happy to help with [smaller piece] if that works, but I can't own the whole thing.\" That's not flaking\u2014that's correcting course when you realize you overcommitted. What stops you from doing that? Is it \"he'll be annoyed and I don't want the conflict,\" or is it something else?\n\nIf you don't walk it back, then the next six weeks become a live experiment: what happens when you do work that feels pointless because you've already decided to leave? Does the detachment make it easier (just go through the motions, collect the paycheck), or does it make it worse (every day feels like you're lying to yourself about what you're doing there)? Either way, you'll learn something about what you need going forward. But you don't have to wait to find out if you don't want to. You still have the option to say no now, even though you already said yes."

      "assistant": "**Not pushing back on the proposal:**\n\nYou told yourself you would, but when you saw your manager this morning it felt easier to let it go. Now you're committed to six weeks of work you don't want to do, and you're asking \"does it even matter at this point?\" Here's what I'm noticing: you're treating it like it's over and done\u2014\"stupid,\" \"whatever,\" \"too late now.\" But that framing skips right past the part where you made a choice in real time based on what felt survivable in that moment. Seeing your manager, imagining the conflict, and deciding \"I don't have the energy for this fight right now\" isn't stupid. It's you doing triage. The cost is six weeks of pointless work. The alternative cost was a confrontation you didn't feel equipped to handle today. You picked the one that felt more manageable. That's not failure\u2014it's just what happens when both options suck and you're already running on empty.\n\nBut here's the thing: it does matter. Not because you made the wrong call, but because this is the same pattern that got you into the legal mess in the first place\u2014saying yes when you want to say no, avoiding conflict in the moment, and then carrying the weight of it afterward. You can see it happening, you're frustrated with yourself for it, and you still don't know how to interrupt it in real time. That's the part worth paying attention to. What would need to be true for you to say no in the moment next time, instead of telling yourself you will and then not doing it when it counts?\n\n**The hollow feeling even though you have a plan:**\n\nYou updated your resume, reached out to people, have a plan to move in with your sister\u2014logically all good. But you're just going through it. Work feels pointless, home feels quiet even when people are around, and you keep telling yourself you'll feel better once you leave. But now you're wondering: what if leaving doesn't actually change anything? What if the problem is just you being like this, and leaving the job won't fix it?\n\nThat fear\u2014\"what if I'm the problem and changing my circumstances won't help\"\u2014makes sense when you're this depleted. You've been in crisis mode for weeks, you've made a bunch of hard decisions, and now you're in the in-between space where the bad thing (current job) isn't over yet but the next thing (new job, living with your sister) hasn't started. That's limbo. You're not in the crisis anymore, but you're also not in the relief yet. You're just... waiting. And waiting feels hollow because there's no immediate problem to solve, no adrenaline pushing you forward, just the slow slog of showing up to a job you've already mentally left while you figure out what's next. That flatness you're describing isn't you being broken\u2014it's what happens when your nervous system finally stops running on cortisol and realizes how tired it actually is.\n\nBut let me push back on \"what if the problem is just me being like this.\" You weren't like this before the job got bad. You didn't start isolating and feeling hollow until work became crushing and your manager kept putting you in impossible positions. The withdrawal, the detachment, the \"going through the motions\" feeling\u2014those showed up in response to something. They're not just who you are. They're how you adapted to an environment that was grinding you down. And yeah, those adaptations are still running even though the acute crisis is mostly over, because your nervous system hasn't fully registered that it's safe to come back online yet. Leaving the job won't instantly fix that\u2014you're right about that. But it removes the thing that's actively depleting you, which gives you space to start refilling. That's not nothing.\n\n**Jason texting and you saying \"maybe, need to see how I feel\":**\n\nHe asked if you wanted to do something this weekend and you said maybe, need to see how you feel. You can see it's the old pattern\u2014you just proved to yourself that hanging out with him is actually fine, but now you're already pulling back again. You said it's like you can't maintain anything even when you have proof it works.\n\nHere's what might be happening: you're confusing \"I know logically that hanging out with Jason goes well\" with \"I feel like I have the energy to do it right now.\" Those are different things. The proof that it works doesn't override the fact that you're still running on fumes and everything feels like effort, even good things. You're not pulling back because you've forgotten that connection is good for you\u2014you're pulling back because you're still in survival mode and your body is still saying \"conserve energy, don't commit to anything that might cost more than you have.\"\n\nThe pattern isn't that you can't maintain things. The pattern is that when you're depleted, you retreat\u2014even from things that would help. And right now, you're still depleted. Updating your resume and making a plan didn't magically restore your capacity. It just gave you a path forward. You're still in the hard part where you have to keep showing up (to work, to life, to people) even though you don't feel like you have much left to give. That's not you failing to maintain progress. That's you still in the thick of it.\n\nOne thing to consider: what if instead of saying \"maybe, need to see how I feel,\" you checked in with him about what actually sounds manageable? \"I'm pretty fried this week\u2014want to just hang at your place and watch something instead of going out?\" or \"Can we do something low-key? I don't have energy for anything big.\" That way you're not forcing yourself into plans that feel like too much, but you're also not defaulting to \"maybe\" and leaving it ambiguous. You're defining what connection looks like when you're running on empty, instead of treating it like an all-or-nothing thing. Does that feel doable, or is even that more than you've got right now?\n\n**The \"slipping back into patterns\" fear:**\n\nYou feel like you're slipping back into patterns you thought you were getting past. But look at what you've actually done in the last two weeks: you emailed legal and protected yourself. You told your sister what's been going on and accepted her offer to stay with you. You updated your resume and reached out to old contacts. You texted Jason and had lunch with him even though you were dreading it. You're still showing up to work even though it feels hollow. That's not slipping back\u2014that's you holding it together in the middle of a hard transition while your brain tells you that you're failing. The patterns are still there (saying yes when you mean no, pulling back from connection when you're depleted), but you're also doing things differently than you were a month ago. Both can be true at the same time. You're not back where you started. You're just not all the way out yet."

      "assistant": "**Texting Jason back:**\n\nYou texted him \"low-key this weekend?\" and he was cool with it\u2014you're just gonna hang at his place. You said it's a small thing but it felt better than the whole \"maybe\" thing. That's not small. That's you naming what you actually have capacity for instead of leaving it vague or forcing yourself into something that feels like too much. And Jason met you there without pushback, which reinforces something important: when you're honest about where you're at, people who care about you work with it. You're learning that boundaries don't cost you connection\u2014they actually make connection more sustainable.\n\n**You pushed back on the proposal:**\n\nYou told your manager you needed to scale back because you're handling other stuff and can't give it the full six weeks. He seemed annoyed but didn't fight it hard. And you did it\u2014finally, didn't sit in it for days beforehand, just said it when you saw him. That's a completely different move than what's been happening. For weeks you've been saying yes when you mean no, telling yourself you'll push back later, and then not doing it. This time you actually followed through. You saw the moment, said the thing, and set the boundary in real time. That's not a small shift. That's you proving to yourself that you *can* do this, even when it's uncomfortable.\n\n**The flatness (and the question underneath it):**\n\nYou'd think pushing back on the proposal would feel good, but instead you're just tired. Even small wins feel hollow right now. You keep waiting to feel excited about moving in with your sister, or the fact that people are calling back about jobs, but it's all flat\u2014you know intellectually that good things are happening but emotionally it's like you're watching it happen to someone else. And you're asking: is that normal? Are you supposed to feel something when things are going better? Or is this just what the tail end of burnout feels like?\n\nYeah, this is what the tail end of burnout feels like. You spent weeks in crisis mode\u2014work crushing you, legal situation hanging over your head, manager putting you in impossible spots, isolating from everyone, running on adrenaline and dread. Your nervous system was in overdrive just to survive that. Now the acute crisis is mostly over\u2014you've made the big decisions, you have a plan, things are objectively moving in a better direction\u2014but your body hasn't caught up yet. It's still in \"conserve everything, don't trust this, stay flat and protected\" mode because it doesn't fully believe the threat is gone. Emotionally you're still braced for the next bad thing, even though logically you know you're headed somewhere better.\n\nThat disconnect between \"I know this is good\" and \"I don't feel anything about it\" is exhausting in its own way. You want to feel relief, excitement, something\u2014but instead there's just this hollow going-through-the-motions feeling. And that makes you wonder if something's wrong with you, or if you'll ever feel normal again. But here's what's actually happening: feeling flat after prolonged stress is protective. Your nervous system learned that getting hopeful or excited leaves you vulnerable, so it's keeping everything muted until it's sure you're actually safe. That's not permanent. It's just where you are right now while your body catches up to the fact that things are genuinely shifting.\n\nOne thing that might help: you don't have to wait to \"feel excited\" for it to count. The fact that you're doing the things\u2014pushing back on your manager, texting Jason, moving forward with the job search, planning the move\u2014that's what matters. The feelings will come back when your system stops running on fumes and starts to believe that the worst is actually over. Right now you're still in the hard middle part where you're doing everything right but it doesn't feel like anything yet. That's normal. It doesn't mean the progress isn't real."

      "assistant": "**Hanging out with Jason:**\n\nYou sat around his place, watched something, didn't have to talk much\u2014and you didn't feel amazing but you also weren't forcing it. Just present, which is more than you've been able to do in a while. That \"just present\" thing is worth way more than you're giving it credit for. A few weeks ago, the idea of any social plan felt like a weight you couldn't carry. Now you're showing up and actually being there instead of spending the whole time in your head about whether you should've cancelled. That's not nothing. Your capacity is coming back, even if it's quiet and doesn't feel like a big shift yet.\n\n**The job email sitting in your inbox:**\n\nSomeone you reached out to wants to chat next week, and instead of feeling excited it's just kind of sitting there. You know you should follow up but it feels like going through the motions. That makes complete sense given where you are right now\u2014your nervous system is still in \"don't get hopeful, don't invest emotional energy in things that might not work out\" mode. Following up on a job lead requires you to believe that something better is actually possible, and right now you're too depleted to access that belief. So it just sits there as another task on the list instead of feeling like an opportunity.\n\nHere's the thing: you don't need to feel excited about it for it to matter. Just reply and set up the call. Let the action come first and see if the feeling follows later. Sometimes we wait to feel motivated or excited before we act, but when you're running on empty, it works the other way around\u2014you do the thing even though it feels flat, and then maybe three calls in or three weeks from now, something starts to shift and you realize you actually care about one of these options. You're not required to perform enthusiasm to make progress. Just move the piece forward and let that be enough for now.\n\n**Your sister asking if you've heard anything:**\n\nShe keeps checking in, trying to be supportive, but it makes you feel worse somehow\u2014like she's checking on whether you're actually moving forward with the plan or just stalling. That's a tough spot. She's offering the support you need (a place to stay, encouragement about the job search), but the way it lands feels like pressure or monitoring instead of help. Part of that might be your own sensitivity right now\u2014when you're already feeling flat and disconnected, even gentle check-ins can feel like \"am I doing enough, am I moving fast enough, am I failing at this too?\" But it might also be worth naming it to her if it keeps bugging you. Not as a criticism, just as information: \"Hey, I know you're trying to help and I appreciate it, but when you ask about the job stuff it makes me feel like I'm being checked on. I'm handling it, I'll let you know when there's an update.\" That gives her a way to support you that doesn't add to the weight you're already carrying.\n\n**Work improving but it not mattering:**\n\nThe proposal got scaled back, your manager's been quieter, and it's less suffocating. But you're realizing that even if the job situation improves it doesn't matter because you already know you're leaving. So what's the point of trying to make it better? You're just going through the motions until the end of next month. That's exactly right\u2014and that's not a problem, that's just what this phase looks like. You're not there to fix the job or make it work long-term. You're there to collect a paycheck while you build the exit. The fact that it's less suffocating now just makes that easier. You don't have to care about it or invest in it. You can let it be a thing you do on autopilot for a few more weeks while your energy goes toward the stuff that actually matters (job search, planning the move, taking care of yourself). Going through the motions is the appropriate response when you're in a temporary holding pattern. Don't make it mean more than it is.\n\n**How long does the flatness usually last:**\n\nYou get that your body's still in protection mode, but you're asking: how long does this usually last? Because it's starting to feel like just how you are now instead of temporary. And you keep wondering if maybe the problem isn't the job, maybe it's just you being broken or something.\n\nThere's no universal timeline for how long it takes to come out of this, because it depends on how long you were running on empty and what happens next. But here's what I can tell you: the flatness doesn't lift all at once, and it doesn't lift while you're still in the environment that depleted you in the first place. Right now you're still showing up to the job every day, still in the same apartment knowing you're leaving soon, still in the in-between space where the hard thing isn't over but the better thing hasn't started. Your nervous system isn't going to fully relax until you're actually *out*\u2014moved in with your sister, not going to that job anymore, in a new routine that doesn't have the old triggers embedded in it. That's when you'll start to notice small shifts: a morning where you wake up and don't immediately feel dread, a conversation where you're actually engaged instead of watching yourself go through it, a moment where something feels good instead of just fine.\n\nBut even then, it's gradual. You don't go from flat to fully alive overnight. You go from flat to \"huh, that was kind of nice\" to \"I'm starting to feel more like myself\" to \"oh, I actually care about this.\" And that process takes weeks, maybe months, depending on how deep the depletion went. The fact that you're worried it's permanent makes sense\u2014when you've been flat for this long, it's hard to remember what it felt like to not be flat. But \"broken\" isn't what's happening here. Broken would be if nothing you did made any difference, if the job situation improved and you pulled back from people and isolated more and felt worse. That's not what's happening. You're pushing back on your manager now. You're showing up for Jason. You're following through on the job search even though it feels like going through the motions. You're still doing the things, even though they don't feel like anything yet. That's not broken\u2014that's you functioning in survival mode while you wait for your system to catch up. It will. It just hasn't yet."

      "assistant": "**The interview:**\n\nYou had the call, it went fine, they want you to come in next week for a real interview\u2014and it's just another thing on the list right now. Cool, interview, cool. You didn't even tell your sister yet because what if it doesn't pan out anyway. That protective \"don't get invested, don't tell anyone, don't let it mean anything\" response makes complete sense when you've been running on empty this long. Your brain is trying to save you from disappointment by keeping everything at arm's length. But here's what actually happened: you reached out, someone responded, you had the call, and now there's a real interview on the calendar. That's momentum, even if it doesn't feel like anything yet. You don't have to perform excitement about it. Just show up to the interview next week and see what happens. The feeling might come later, or it might not come until you actually have an offer in hand and realize you're out. Either way, you're doing the thing.\n\n**The waiting feeling (and the \"I'm not actually living, just counting down\" thing):**\n\nYou're stuck here for another month and a half before the move happens, and every day feels like waiting\u2014not actually living, just counting down. You said it's stupid because objectively things are better (work is fine now, you're seeing people, you have a plan), but you feel like you're just existing until the real part of your life starts again. That's not stupid. That's what limbo feels like. You've made the decision to leave, you know where you're going, but you're not there yet\u2014and the in-between space is its own kind of hard. You're no longer in crisis mode (which at least had adrenaline and urgency), but you're also not in the relief of being out yet. You're just... here. Showing up to a job you've already left mentally, living in a place you're moving out of soon, waiting for the next thing to start. That \"just existing\" feeling is real, and it's depressing, and you're right that it probably won't fully lift until you're actually out of this environment.\n\nBut here's the thing: you asked how to get through the waiting part without just white-knuckling through six weeks feeling like this. And I think the answer is you stop treating the next six weeks as \"not the real part of your life.\" Because this *is* your life\u2014right now, today, this week. The move and the new job and the fresh start\u2014that's all coming, and it matters, but it's not where you are yet. If you spend the next six weeks in \"nothing counts until I'm out\" mode, you're going to get to your sister's place in a month and a half and realize you just lost six weeks to waiting. That doesn't mean you have to love being here or feel grateful for the job or pretend everything's fine. It just means asking: what would make these six weeks feel a little less like purgatory and a little more like you're still here, still living, even if it's temporary?\n\nMaybe that's seeing Jason once a week instead of once every two weeks. Maybe it's one small thing you do for yourself that has nothing to do with the job or the move\u2014a book you've been wanting to read, a place you've been meaning to check out, something that's just for you and not part of the plan. Maybe it's letting yourself actually rest instead of treating every moment as \"I should be doing something productive to get out of here faster.\" I don't know what it is for you, but the question is: what would make this holding pattern feel more bearable instead of just something to endure? Not because you owe it to anyone to make the best of it, but because you're the one who has to live these six weeks and you might as well make them suck a little less if you can.\n\n**The realization about your manager:**\n\nYou pushed back on the proposal and he didn't fight you that hard, and now you're realizing maybe you've been giving him more power in your head than he actually has. He's annoyed when you set boundaries but he's not going to destroy you over it. You said maybe that's obvious, but it's also kind of a shift. It is a shift\u2014and it's a big one. For weeks you've been operating like pushing back on him would be catastrophic: he'd retaliate, he'd make your life hell, he'd punish you for not complying. But when you actually did it, he was just... annoyed. And then he moved on. That gap between what you feared would happen and what actually happened is everything. It means the power he had over you was mostly the power you gave him by assuming the worst. And now that you've tested it and seen that he's just a guy who gets annoyed and then lets it go, the dynamic changes. You're not as trapped as you thought you were. You can set boundaries and survive them. That's not a small thing to learn, and it's going to matter in the next job too\u2014knowing that you can push back without it being the end of the world."
