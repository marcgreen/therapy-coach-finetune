      "assistant": "A lot landed this week: the job decision, the chest pain worry, and feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**Job decision:** It sounds like you're caught between the pull of the new opportunity and the fear of the unknown. It's totally normal to feel conflicted when making big decisions \u2013 it's a sign you're taking it seriously. Your friends are right that indecision can be draining, but your brain is trying to protect you from a bad outcome. One helpful move would be to pick one of the \"what ifs\" and spend 5 minutes listing evidence *for* and *against* it.\n\n**Chest pain:** It's understandable to be worried when you're experiencing physical symptoms, especially when it's new. The urge to Google is strong, but as you said, it can really amplify anxiety. My working guess is the chest pain is related to stress, but I also hear that you're questioning whether it\u2019s worth bothering the doctor. What do you think about scheduling that appointment, even just to rule things out and get some reassurance?\n\n**Feeling overwhelmed/pessimistic:** It\u2019s tough when you feel like you're always anticipating the worst. It might be that you're used to bracing for things to go wrong, and it\u2019s hard to let go of that habit. One thing you could try is picking one small, positive activity to do today \u2013 something that usually brings you a little joy. Did you want to talk more about the job decision or the chest pain, or maybe something else entirely?"

      "user": "ugh ok so i went to the doctor about the chest thing and they basically said its nothing which like i guess is good but also now i feel dumb for going. they were like its probably anxiety or muscle strain and i should try to relax more which is the most useless advice ever bc if i could just relax i would lol\n\nanyway the job thing is still completely up in the air. i did that thing you said about listing evidence for one of the what ifs and honestly it just made me more confused bc there are good points on both sides. like the new job pays more and has better benefits but what if i get there and realize i made a huge mistake. i cant stop thinking about how my current job might appreciate me more if i tried to leave or like what if they counter offer and then i have to decide all over again\n\nalso my roommate has been super annoying lately which isnt helping. shes always having people over and being loud when im trying to sleep and i know i should say something but i dont wanna start drama. its just one more thing on top of everything else\n\ntbh i still think something might be wrong with me even though the doctor said im fine. like what if they missed something or what if it gets worse later. idk maybe im just being paranoid but the chest thing still happens sometimes",
      "assistant": "It sounds like a lot came up after the doctor's visit - relief mixed with feeling dismissed, plus the job stress and roommate situation.\n\n**Doctor's visit:** It's completely understandable to feel a bit silly or frustrated after being told \"just relax.\" Doctors aren't always equipped to address the underlying anxiety that fuels these worries. It's valid to feel like you wasted their time, but you also took a brave step in seeking care. It's a common experience to feel unsettled even after getting reassurance.\n\n**Job:** The \"evidence for/against\" exercise can sometimes muddy the waters, especially with big decisions. It highlights the complexity, which is a good reminder that there's no perfect choice. It sounds like you\u2019re worried about regret either way. One thing you could try is to pick one small action related to the job decision \u2013 maybe updating your resume or having a casual chat with a former colleague. Does that feel doable, or would something else fit better?\n\n**Roommate:** It's tricky navigating roommate conflicts, and it\u2019s totally normal to want to avoid drama. It's valid that her behavior is disrupting your sleep \u2013 that's a basic need. A small step could be writing down a few sentences about what you\u2019d like to say, even if you don\u2019t say them yet.\n\n**Chest pain/health worries:** Even though the doctor said you're fine, it's tough to shake that worry. I wonder if that feeling of \"what if they missed something\" is connected to your anxiety about the job and your roommate. It sounds like you're searching for certainty in a situation where there isn't any. What\u2019s one small thing you could do right now to ground yourself in the present moment?"

      "user": "been thinking about what you said and idk if grounding myself really helps bc my brain just keeps going anyway. like i tried that deep breathing thing everyone always talks about and it just made me more aware of my chest which made me panic more lol so that was great\n\nupdate on the job stuff tho i guess. i talked to my manager yesterday about potentially leaving and it went SO badly. like she basically implied i was being ungrateful and that no other company would value me the way they do which is insane bc they barely give me any recognition for the work i do. now im even more stressed bc what if shes right and im just gonna be miserable anywhere i go. maybe the problem is me and not the job\n\nalso i didnt say anything to my roommate yet bc the other night when she had people over i heard her complaining about ME to her friends. she was saying im uptight and no fun which like whatever but now i definitely cant bring up the noise thing or ill just prove her right. so im stuck dealing with it i guess\n\nanyway now my chest has been hurting more the past couple days and im trying not to spiral about it again but its hard when it literally keeps happening. the doctor said it was nothing but what if its one of those things that gets worse over time and by the time they figure it out itll be too late. i know that sounds dramatic but people miss stuff all the time right",
      "assistant": "That sounds like a really rough couple of days. It's tough when things feel like they're piling on.\n\n**Grounding/Breathing:** It\u2019s completely valid that grounding exercises didn't work this time - sometimes they can backfire when anxiety is high. It's not a reflection of you or your ability to cope. Your brain is working overtime, and forcing calm can sometimes amplify the distress.\n\n**Job conversation:** Oof, that sounds incredibly invalidating from your manager. It's understandable to feel stressed and question yourself after that. Her response seems more about protecting her own position than acknowledging your concerns. It's possible she's right about your value, but her delivery was totally off. One helpful move would be to list three specific accomplishments you've made at your current job. It might help you separate her opinion from your own assessment of your skills.\n\n**Roommate:** Hearing her complain about you to her friends is a really hurtful experience. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re hesitant to confront her now. You\u2019re caught between needing to protect your sleep and wanting to avoid confirming her perception of you. One small step could be to notice when you\u2019re having thoughts about her comments and gently remind yourself that her opinion isn\u2019t the whole truth.\n\n**Chest pain/health worries:** It\u2019s really hard when physical symptoms persist, especially after being reassured by a doctor. You\u2019re navigating a tricky balance of acknowledging your anxiety and respecting the doctor's assessment. It\u2019s natural to worry about missed diagnoses, but catastrophizing can make the symptoms feel even more intense. You said you know it sounds dramatic, but it\u2019s okay to acknowledge the fear. What's one thing you could do today, even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes, to shift your focus away from your chest?"

      "assistant": "This sounds like a really challenging week, and it's okay to feel disappointed and frustrated.\n\n**Accomplishments/Coworker promotion:** It\u2019s understandable that you felt stupid listing your accomplishments, especially with your manager\u2019s reaction fresh in your mind. It\u2019s tough when external validation feels out of reach. Your friend\u2019s comment about self-sabotage might sting, but it\u2019s possible she\u2019s pointing out a pattern of avoiding risk. It\u2019s also possible she's not seeing the full picture. One thing you could do is write down those two accomplishments and three things you\u2019re proud of about yourself, unrelated to work. Just for you.\n\n**Job decision:** It's completely valid to feel safer sticking with what you know, even if it's not ideal. It\u2019s a tough spot being stuck and having your manager aware you were looking. It takes courage to make changes, and it's okay to feel hesitant. Your friend's perspective is just one view.\n\n**Roommate:** Avoiding her is a valid strategy for self-preservation right now.\n\n**Chest pain/Arm:** It\u2019s really tough when physical symptoms persist, and your anxiety is amplifying your worries. It\u2019s normal to question the initial assessment, especially when you're feeling stressed. You\u2019re right to explore your options \u2013 getting a second opinion or asking for more tests is reasonable. It sounds like you\u2019re feeling unheard and dismissed, and that's a valid concern. What would feel most reassuring right now - scheduling a follow up, or exploring a different way to manage the anxiety around the chest pain?"

      "assistant": "It sounds like you're navigating a really frustrating cycle of seeking reassurance and feeling dismissed.\n\n**Doctor\u2019s visit/Tests:** It\u2019s understandable to feel annoyed and brushed off by the doctor, especially when you\u2019re genuinely worried. It\u2019s valid to advocate for yourself, but it\u2019s also tough when you feel like you\u2019re being perceived as difficult. Her suggestion to talk to someone about anxiety, while potentially helpful, felt dismissive in the moment. You're right to point out that it feels real, even if tests come back normal.\n\n**Chest pain/Body signals:** It's incredibly difficult to ignore physical sensations when you\u2019re feeling anxious. Your body\u2019s signals are real, even if the underlying cause isn\u2019t what you initially feared. You\u2019re right to acknowledge the frustration of not having answers. It\u2019s like your body is sending you a message, and you\u2019re struggling to decipher it.\n\n**Work:** Your manager\u2019s reaction sounds incredibly unfair and unsupportive. It\u2019s understandable to regret sharing your job search plans. It\u2019s easy to get caught in the trap of thinking \"what's the point\" when things feel bleak. Your friend's suggestion to look again is valid, but it's also okay to acknowledge that it feels overwhelming right now.\n\n**List of accomplishments:** It\u2019s tough when something intended to be helpful ends up feeling deflating. Those \"small\" achievements *are* valuable \u2013 showing up consistently, completing projects, contributing to your team. They reflect effort and resilience. One thing you could try is reframe those accomplishments as stepping stones. What did you *learn* from them? How did they contribute to your growth? Can you think of one small step you could take to build on one of those accomplishments?"

      "assistant": "Okay, that\u2019s a lot to process. Quitting impulsively is understandable given what you described about your manager's behavior. It sounds like you reached a breaking point.\n\n**Quitting/No backup plan:** It's incredibly brave to walk away from a toxic situation, even if it was impulsive. You're now facing the consequences, which are undeniably stressful \u2013 unemployment, financial uncertainty, and a lack of immediate options. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge that you\u2019re in a tough spot. Your roommate's comment may sting, but she's likely observing the very real distress you're experiencing.\n\n**Job search/Applications:** It\u2019s completely normal to feel paralyzed and discouraged when facing a job search, especially with the added pressure of financial worries. The feeling of being unqualified or overwhelmed is a common barrier. One small step could be setting a timer for 15 minutes each day to focus solely on job searching, without judgment.\n\n**Chest pain/Physical symptoms:** The constant chest pain is understandably concerning, and it's valid to feel frustrated with the lack of definitive answers. It\u2019s tough to navigate the tension between acknowledging your anxiety and addressing a persistent physical symptom. You're right to feel hesitant about going back to the doctor, but your concerns are valid.\n\n**Dealing with anxiety:** It's completely reasonable to feel overwhelmed by the idea of addressing anxiety on top of everything else. It\u2019s not about \u201cfixing\u201d it overnight. It\u2019s about finding ways to manage the distress and build coping skills. Talking to someone is a good starting point, but it\u2019s not the entire solution. One small step could be exploring different therapy options or mindfulness exercises.\n\nRight now, it sounds like you're dealing with a cascade of stressors. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge that you need support and to prioritize self-care. Let's focus on one thing: What's one small, manageable step you could take today, regardless of how you\u2019re feeling?"

      "assistant": "Okay, that's a really difficult situation. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of shame and frustration layered on top of the initial distress.\n\n**Job search:** It\u2019s completely understandable that you couldn't manage the job search. Feeling overwhelmed and like a failure is a natural response to this pressure. Your roommate's comments are unhelpful and likely adding to your stress. It's okay to give yourself a break.\n\n**Episode/Ambulance:** That sounds terrifying, and it\u2019s completely valid to have called for help when you felt like you were dying. It's understandable to feel embarrassed or stupid about the ambulance bill and the paramedic's response, but it wasn\u2019t your fault you were experiencing that level of distress. The bill is a logistical hurdle, and we can explore resources for that later if you'd like.\n\n**Therapists:** It's frustrating to encounter financial and logistical barriers to mental health care. The difficulty in finding the right therapist is real. It\u2019s okay to feel skeptical or discouraged. One small step could be researching local community mental health centers, which often offer lower-cost options.\n\n**Body/Panic attacks:** You're right to question the duration of panic attacks. It's valid to feel like something more might be going on. It\u2019s understandable to feel like the doctors aren\u2019t taking your concerns seriously. It\u2019s okay to explore your options and advocate for yourself.\n\nRight now, you\u2019re facing a perfect storm of job insecurity, financial stress, physical symptoms, and emotional exhaustion. You mentioned feeling like talking to someone is pointless. It's not about magically fixing everything. It's about creating a space to process your feelings, develop coping strategies, and feel less alone.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on one thing. What\u2019s one small act of self-compassion you can offer yourself today? It doesn\u2019t have to be big or dramatic."

It\u2019s a testament to you that you\u2019re even attempting to care for yourself amidst this chaos.\n\n**Self-compassion:** It\u2019s not about feeling good all the time. It\u2019s about acknowledging your suffering without judgment and treating yourself with kindness. It\u2019s about recognizing that you\u2019re going through a difficult time and that you deserve care.\n\n**Job applications:** Applying to jobs is a concrete step, even if the options aren't ideal. It\u2019s okay to feel disappointed by the rejections, and it's valid to acknowledge the financial trade-offs.\n\n**Chest pain/Ignoring it:** Ignoring a physical symptom is rarely a long-term solution, but it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed and hesitant to seek more medical attention. Your roommate\u2019s suggestion of yoga or meditation might feel dismissive, but they can be helpful tools for managing anxiety.\n\n**Community mental health:** The waitlists and intake appointments are a significant barrier.

It's incredibly draining. It sounds like you're feeling unheard and unsupported, both medically and emotionally.\n\nLet\u2019s shift focus slightly. Instead of trying to fix everything right now, what\u2019s one small thing you can do to ease the burden on yourself, even if it\u2019s just for a few minutes? It could be something simple like listening to a song you enjoy, taking a short walk, or reaching out to a friend."

      "assistant": "It sounds like the anticipation of starting the new job, combined with the resurgence of physical symptoms, is creating a perfect storm of anxiety.\n\n**Mental health appointment:** It\u2019s valid to question whether therapy will be helpful. It's understandable to feel skeptical about hearing things you already know. Therapy isn\u2019t about giving you new information, it\u2019s about helping you develop new ways of *relating* to that information and changing patterns of behavior.\n\n**Target job:** It's incredibly common to feel anxious about starting a new job, even when you need it. The \"what ifs\" are powerful, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge them. Remind yourself that everyone starts somewhere, and it\u2019s okay to make mistakes. One small step could be identifying one task you're likely to be good at, and focusing on that during your first few shifts.\n\n**Chest pain:** The return of the chest pain is understandably worrying, especially with the other stressors you're facing. You're right to question whether it's different this time. It\u2019s okay to advocate for yourself and explore your options, but try to also balance that with managing the anxiety that's likely amplifying the discomfort. It\u2019s okay to feel paranoid, but try to notice when those thoughts are taking over.\n\n**Roommate:** It\u2019s tough navigating those awkward conversational moments. It's understandable to feel like you've missed the window to address the noise issue. You don\u2019t have to bring it up right now, and it\u2019s okay to prioritize your own well-being.\n\nRight now, you're carrying a lot of weight. It's okay to acknowledge that it feels overwhelming. What's one small act of self-care you can do today, even if it's just for a few minutes, to help you manage the anxiety and physical discomfort?"

      "user": "so first day at target was actually fine? like not amazing but i didnt have a panic attack or mess anything up so thats something. my manager seems chill and the other people training with me were nice enough. idk if ill stick with it long term but for now its whatever\n\nanyway i went down a rabbit hole last night googling chest pain again and found this whole thing about costochondritis which is like inflammation of the chest wall or something. all the symptoms match what ive been feeling and apparently doctors miss it all the time bc it doesnt show up on normal tests. now im like 90% sure thats what i have but also i already went to the doctor twice so idk if i should bring it up or if theyll just think im being annoying again\n\nalso i know you keep saying therapy will help with changing patterns or whatever but like what if im just bad at therapy too. what if i sit there and cant think of anything to say or i say the wrong things and waste everyones time. plus the appointment is still a week away and it feels so far when everything is happening now\n\nmy roommate had people over again last night and i almost said something but then i chickened out. i hate that i cant just be normal about conflict like a regular person",
      "assistant": "That's fantastic news about the first day at Target! It's a huge accomplishment to navigate a new work environment without a panic attack. It sounds like you\u2019re finding some unexpected positive elements.\n\n**Target job:** It's great that your manager seems chill and you connected with the other trainees. Give yourself credit for showing up and doing your best.\n\n**Chest pain/Costochondritis:** It\u2019s understandable to feel hopeful about the costochondritis possibility, but it\u2019s also natural to be hesitant about bringing it up to the doctor again. You're valid in wanting to be heard and validated, but also in wanting to avoid being perceived as difficult. One small step could be writing down a few specific details about your symptoms and how they align with costochondritis, so you can clearly communicate those to the doctor if you choose to follow up.\n\n**Therapy:** Your concerns about being \"bad at therapy\" are completely valid. It's a vulnerable process, and it\u2019s normal to feel anxious about it. It's okay to acknowledge that it might be uncomfortable or challenging. Therapy isn\u2019t about saying the \"right\" things, it's about creating a safe space to explore your thoughts and feelings. One small step could be jotting down a few things you're hoping to get out of therapy, to help guide the conversation.\n\n**Roommate/Conflict:** It\u2019s tough to navigate conflict, and it\u2019s okay to feel like you\u2019re not \u201cnormal\u201d about it. You\u2019re prioritizing avoiding drama, which is a valid choice. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge your discomfort without judgment.\n\nRight now, you're balancing a new job, lingering physical concerns, and social anxieties. It's a lot to manage. What\u2019s one small thing you can do today to prioritize your well-being? Maybe it\u2019s a short walk, a cup of tea, or a few minutes of quiet time."

      "user": "been working at target for like a week now and its honestly kind of mind numbing but in a good way? like i just scan things and help customers find stuff and i dont have to think about anything complicated. the pay sucks obviously but at least im not stressed about my manager hating me or whatever\n\nso i chickened out on bringing up the costochondritis thing to my doctor bc i realized id have to make another appointment and pay another copay and im broke rn. but the chest pain has been way better this week so maybe it was just stress like everyone said all along idk. or maybe it is costochondritis and its just calming down on its own\n\nanyway therapy appointment is tomorrow and im lowkey dreading it. i keep thinking about what im gonna say and then my mind goes blank. like do i start with the job stuff or the health anxiety or the fact that i quit my job impulsively or what. also what if the therapist is weird or judgey or just doesnt get it. my friend said her therapist fell asleep during a session once which sounds like my nightmare lol\n\noh also i still havent said anything to my roommate about the noise and now i feel like its been too long and itll be awkward to bring up. shes been quieter this week anyway so maybe its fine",
      "assistant": "It\u2019s great to hear that Target is providing a sense of routine and a break from intense stress. It sounds like the mind-numbing aspect is surprisingly helpful.\n\n**Target job:** Finding a job that offers a reprieve from anxiety is a significant win. The financial trade-off is a real challenge, but it\u2019s good that you\u2019re not dealing with the stress of your previous manager.\n\n**Chest pain/Costochondritis:** It\u2019s understandable to put off another doctor's appointment when finances are tight. It\u2019s encouraging that the chest pain has improved, and it\u2019s okay to wonder if it was stress-related. It\u2019s also valid to still have questions about costochondritis.\n\n**Therapy appointment:** Your anxiety about the therapy appointment is completely normal. It\u2019s okay to feel unsure about what to say and to worry about the therapist\u2019s reaction. You don't need to have everything figured out before you go. A good therapist will help you explore those thoughts and feelings. One small step could be reminding yourself that the first session is often an introductory conversation, and you don\u2019t need to share your entire life story.\n\n**Roommate/Noise:** It\u2019s okay to feel like it's been too long to bring up the noise issue. Sometimes, things resolve themselves naturally. You're prioritizing your own peace, and that's valid.\n\nYou\u2019re navigating a lot of uncertainty and anxiety. It\u2019s okay to feel apprehensive about the therapy appointment. The fact that you're thinking about it and anticipating potential challenges shows that you\u2019re engaged in the process.\n\nWhat\u2019s one small thing you can do to ground yourself today, before your therapy appointment? Maybe a few deep breaths, a short walk, or listening to a favorite song?"

      "user": "went to therapy yesterday and idk how i feel about it tbh. the therapist was nice i guess but she kept asking me all these questions about my childhood and family stuff which felt kinda irrelevant? like i came in to talk about the anxiety and panic attacks and she wanted to know about my relationship with my parents. maybe thats normal for therapy but it felt weird\n\nshe did say the chest pain is definitely anxiety related which i mean everyone has been saying that but hearing it from a therapist somehow made it feel more real. she wants me to try this breathing exercise thing where you breathe in for 4 and out for 6 or something but i havent tried it yet bc it sounds like the same stuff that didnt work before\n\nwork has been fine i guess. one of my coworkers is super chatty and keeps trying to be friends which is nice but also exhausting bc i just wanna do my job and go home. she asked if i wanted to hang out this weekend and i said maybe but i definitely dont actually wanna go\n\nanyway my roommate had this huge party friday night and i didnt say anything again. just put in earplugs and tried to sleep which worked ok i guess. honestly at this point i think im just never gonna bring it up bc whats even the point\n\nalso i got rejected from like 3 more jobs i applied to which is cool bc target is definitely where i wanna be forever lol",
      "assistant": "It sounds like the first therapy session left you feeling a bit confused and unsure. That's a really common experience, and it\u2019s okay to feel that way.\n\n**Therapy:** Your feeling that the focus on childhood and family felt irrelevant is valid. Many therapists use a background exploration to understand patterns, but it's reasonable to feel disconnected if it doesn't resonate with you. It's okay to bring that up with your therapist in your next session. You can say something like, \"I appreciate you asking about my childhood, but I'm really struggling with the anxiety and panic attacks right now. Could we focus on that for a while?\"\n\n**Breathing exercise:** It\u2019s understandable to be hesitant about trying another breathing exercise if previous attempts haven\u2019t worked. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge that.\n\n**Work/Coworker:** Having a chatty coworker who wants to be friends can be draining, especially when you\u2019re already feeling overwhelmed. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to politely decline invitations without feeling guilty.\n\n**Roommate/Party:** It\u2019s okay to feel like it's too late to bring up the noise issue. Your strategy of using earplugs is a valid way to protect your sleep.\n\n**Job rejections:** The ongoing rejections are disheartening, but it's admirable that you're still applying. It's okay to have a sarcastic sense of humor about it.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re navigating a mix of new experiences \u2013 a new job, therapy, and ongoing social challenges. It\u2019s okay to feel uncertain and to question the process. You\u2019re demonstrating resilience and a willingness to try new things, even when they\u2019re uncomfortable.\n\nWhat\u2019s one small act of self-compassion you can offer yourself today, acknowledging the challenges you're facing?"

      "user": "ok so i did actually try that breathing thing the therapist suggested and it was fine i guess. like it didnt make everything magically better but i tried it before my shift yesterday when i was feeling weird and it helped a little. idk if ill keep doing it tho\n\nanyway i told my coworker i couldnt hang out this weekend and she seemed kinda hurt which made me feel bad but also i just cannot deal with that rn. shes still being friendly at work tho so maybe its fine\n\nthe job rejection thing is still happening but whatever im just gonna stay at target for now and stop torturing myself with applications. like whats the point when i just get rejected anyway\n\noh also i have my second therapy appointment in a few days and im trying to figure out if i should bring up the childhood stuff bothering me or if i should just go with it. like maybe she knows what shes doing and im just being difficult bc i dont wanna talk about my parents idk",
      "assistant": "That's great that you gave the breathing exercise a try and found it helpful, even if it wasn't a miraculous fix. It's a good sign that it had some impact.\n\n**Breathing exercise:** It's okay to decide if it's something you want to continue. Consistency is helpful, but it doesn't have to be a rigid commitment.\n\n**Coworker:** It\u2019s understandable to feel bad when you hurt someone\u2019s feelings, but it\u2019s also okay to prioritize your own boundaries. Her continued friendliness at work suggests she might be understanding.\n\n**Job applications:** It\u2019s smart to shift your focus and stop torturing yourself with applications if they're consistently leading to rejection. Focusing on stability at Target is a reasonable choice.\n\n**Second therapy appointment:** Your hesitation about bringing up the childhood stuff is valid. It's okay to question your therapist's approach and to consider whether it aligns with your goals. You have every right to advocate for what you need in therapy. One option is to tell your therapist, \"I appreciate you exploring my background, but I'm really struggling with the anxiety and panic attacks right now. Could we focus on that for a while?\" You're not being difficult; you're being honest about your needs.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re making progress in setting boundaries and prioritizing your well-being.

      "assistant": "That\u2019s fantastic progress! It's wonderful to hear that you advocated for your needs in therapy and that your therapist responded positively.\n\n**Therapy:** It\u2019s great that you were able to communicate your needs and shift the focus to what's most pressing for you. That's a significant step.\n\n**Paycheck:** It\u2019s understandable to feel deflated by the lower paycheck. Seeing the actual number can be a stark reminder of the financial trade-offs you've made. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge that disappointment. Your friend\u2019s question and your response are a testament to your desire to avoid a difficult conversation.\n\n**Panic attacks/Chest pain:** A week without a panic attack is a significant achievement! It sounds like you're developing a better understanding of your body and recognizing the difference between anxiety-related discomfort and something more serious. It\u2019s okay to still have lingering questions about the chest pain, but it's also good that it's less frequent.\n\n**Roommate:** Bringing up the noise issue \u2013 even in a simple way \u2013 is a victory. Her apology and willingness to be quieter is a positive sign. It's okay if it doesn't magically solve everything, but it's a step in the right direction.\n\nYou\u2019re navigating a lot of challenges with increasing self-awareness and resilience.
