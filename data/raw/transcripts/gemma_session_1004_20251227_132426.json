Like there's this big project deadline coming up and my manager keeps adding more things to it and I'm not sure I can actually get it all done in time. Every time I think I've got a handle on it something else gets thrown at me.\n\nidk I've just been feeling pretty down lately too. Like not super depressed or anything but just kind of blah? It's hard to explain. I'll be fine and then randomly just feel sad for no real reason.\n\nAnyway yeah that's what's going on rn",
      "assistant": "**Work stress:** It sounds like you're juggling a lot with this project\u2014a big deadline, shifting priorities from your manager, and the feeling of being constantly behind. That's a tough spot to be in, and it's understandable that it would leave you feeling overwhelmed. One small step that might help is to pick *one* thing on your list that feels most urgent and focus on that for the next 90 minutes, setting a timer and ignoring everything else.\n\n**Your mood:** That \u201cblah\u201d feeling, the unexpected sadness, is really common when you're under pressure. It's not necessarily a sign of anything major, but it's definitely something to acknowledge. Could it be that you're running on empty and needing more space for yourself?\n\nDid you have a chance to take a break today, even a short one?"

      "user": "been trying the 90 minute thing actually. did it yesterday and got through like half the stuff i needed to which felt good for a minute but then my manager scheduled another meeting and basically said the scope is changing again so now i don't even know what i should be prioritizing\n\ni think the break thing is part of it though. i've been working through lunch most days and then i get home and just collapse on the couch. my roommate keeps asking if i want to hang out or get dinner and i keep saying no because i'm just too tired\n\nthe sad thing is still happening. like yesterday i was fine, got stuff done, felt ok. then this morning i woke up and just felt heavy? idk how else to describe it. couldn't really get myself moving for like an hour\n\nis that normal or should i be worried about it",
      "assistant": "**Work stress:** That's incredibly frustrating \u2013 putting in focused effort, feeling a bit of relief, and then having the goalposts shift *again*. It makes complete sense that you\u2019re feeling unsure about what to prioritize now. My working guess is that the constant changes are making it hard to feel a sense of accomplishment or control. One possibility is to try a \"brain dump\" list first thing tomorrow\u2014just get *everything* swirling in your head onto paper, then schedule 30 minutes to look at it with your manager.\n\n**Social connection & rest:** It\u2019s clear you\u2019re exhausted. Working through lunch and collapsing on the couch is a sign you\u2019re running on fumes. Your roommate noticing and offering connection is a good thing \u2013 it shows you have support available. It might be that saying no repeatedly is reinforcing that feeling of being overwhelmed, and also creating some distance from a potential source of energy.\n\n**Mood & morning heaviness:** That \"heavy\" feeling in the morning\u2014it sounds really draining. It\u2019s completely normal to have fluctuating moods, especially when you\u2019re stressed and depleted. It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of a cycle: exhaustion -> difficulty getting started -> feeling down -> more exhaustion. Is it possible that even a 15-minute walk or a quick phone call with a friend could shift that heaviness a bit?"

      "assistant": "**Work:** Glad the brain dump helped clear some mental space \u2013 that's a really helpful tool. It's frustrating that you haven\u2019t had a chance to talk with your manager yet, but at least you have a clearer picture of what's on your plate.\n\n**Sensory overwhelm & panic:** That episode with your roommate and friends\u2014it sounds like a really intense reaction to a relatively minor trigger. It's understandable that you freaked out. My working guess is that your system is so overloaded that even a small amount of stimulation can feel overwhelming. It\u2019s possible that you experienced a brief panic response, and it's good you recognized it.\n\n**Self-care & boundaries:** The 5-minute walk and saying \"I'm fine\" to your roommate\u2014it\u2019s clear you\u2019re trying to push through, but it also sounds like you\u2019re masking a lot. It might be that you\u2019re prioritizing avoiding conflict over acknowledging your needs. One experiment for the next 24 hours could be to be a little more honest with your roommate \u2013 just a simple, \"Hey, I\u2019m feeling really drained today, could we keep things a bit quieter?\"\n\nDoes that feel manageable, even if it's just for a few hours?"

      "assistant": "**Roommate conversation:** It's great that you opened up to your roommate! It's common to feel a bit silly after holding things in, but you did a brave thing by being honest. His chill reaction is a testament to your roommate\u2019s support, and it's a good sign that you can trust him.\n\n**Work uncertainty:** It's frustrating that your manager acknowledged the workload but didn't offer concrete guidance. It sounds like you're stuck in a loop of trying to anticipate her priorities, which is exhausting. One thing you *could* try\u2014and it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t\u2014is sending her a quick email summarizing your list and asking for her top 3 priorities for the week.\n\n**Panic & physical symptoms:** That second panic episode\u2014the heart racing out of nowhere\u2014is concerning. It\u2019s understandable you're wondering if it's just stress or something else. It\u2019s hard to tell the difference, and it's good you're paying attention to it. My working guess is that your body is in a heightened state of alert, and even small things can trigger a physical response.\n\nOne possibility is to try a brief grounding exercise the *moment* you notice your heart racing\u2014like pressing your feet firmly into the floor, noticing 5 things you can see, and taking 5 slow, deep breaths. Would you be open to trying that next time you feel it, just to see if it helps bring you back to the present?"

      "assistant": "**Grounding experiment:** That's fantastic that the grounding exercise worked *sometimes*\u2014even a partial success is progress. It sounds like catching it early is key. It might be that you need to have a few grounding techniques ready, so you can pick one that feels accessible in the moment.\n\n**Work shifts:** Ugh, being asked to deprioritize something you just put effort into\u2014that's incredibly deflating! It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling frustrated. It sounds like you\u2019re in a cycle of reacting to shifting priorities, which is exhausting.\n\n**Sleep disruption:** The 3am wake-ups are a classic sign of an overactive mind and stress. Using your phone definitely makes it worse\u2014the light and stimulation just keep your brain going. One experiment you could try is a \"brain dump\" and \"tomorrow plan\" *before* bed\u2014just jot down everything that\u2019s swirling in your head and make a quick list of what you\u2019ll tackle tomorrow. Then, put your phone *outside* your bedroom.\n\n**Mom & boundaries:** Avoiding your mom is understandable\u2014you were trying to protect her from worry and yourself from having to explain everything. It's a tricky balance. It\u2019s okay to set boundaries, even with family, but it\u2019s also important to acknowledge that avoiding connection can leave you feeling more isolated. If you feel up to it, could you send her a quick text saying something like, \"Things have been hectic at work, but I'm managing.

The sleep disruption, the looming deadline, the conversation with your mom, and the panic attacks at work\u2014it's clear you're carrying a heavy load.\n\n**Sleep:** It\u2019s frustrating that the brain dump didn\u2019t work consistently. It might be that your brain is still hyper-aroused, and you need something more physically grounding *before* bed. One possibility is a 5-minute body scan\u2014just noticing sensations in your body without judgment. You could try that before the brain dump.\n\n**Work & deadline:** The \"just do your best\" comment\u2014it's well-intentioned, but it doesn\u2019t address the systemic issues. It sounds like you're facing an impossible situation. My working guess is that the constant shifting of priorities and the unrealistic deadline have created a sense of powerlessness. Is there *anyone* at work you trust enough to talk to about the workload and the deadline? Even just to vent?\n\n**Mom & worry:** It's completely understandable that you feel guilty after texting your mom\u2014you were trying to be honest, but now you\u2019re worried about her worry. It\u2019s a common pattern when we\u2019re struggling. You can gently reassure her\u2014\"Mom, I know things are stressful, but I'm doing my best and taking care of myself.\"\n\n**Panic & fear:** The panic attack at work\u2014that\u2019s a really frightening experience. It\u2019s natural to be scared of it happening again, especially if you worry about being seen. It sounds like your anxiety is escalating, and you're feeling increasingly vulnerable.\n\n**\"What's the point?\"**: That question\u2014\"What\u2019s the point of all this?\"\u2014is a big one. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re feeling depleted and disconnected. It\u2019s okay to feel that way, especially when you're facing so much. One small step you could take is to identify *one* thing\u2014anything\u2014that brings you a tiny bit of joy or comfort, and schedule it in for tomorrow. It could be listening to a favorite song, taking a warm bath, or spending 10 minutes with your roommate\u2019s cat.\n\nRight now, it sounds like your focus should be on managing your anxiety and getting some rest.

It\u2019s a pattern of shifting expectations and a lack of support.\n\n**Work & self-care:** The body scan\u2014even if it felt silly\u2014helped you sleep one night, which is a positive sign. Forgetting to do it until you're already in bed is common\u2014it\u2019s a habit to break. One small experiment could be setting an alarm on your phone 30 minutes before bed as a reminder.\n\n**Panic & calling in sick:** Calling in sick\u2014it's a valid response to feeling overwhelmed and needing to protect yourself. It\u2019s okay to prioritize your well-being, even if it feels like you're being \u201cpathetic.\u201d Your roommate bringing soup\u2014that's a small act of kindness that shows he cares.\n\n**Mom & communication:** The thumbs-up emojis\u2014it\u2019s a way of protecting yourself and avoiding a difficult conversation.

It\u2019s hard to answer because recovery isn't linear.

      "user": "been looking at job postings like you said. found one that actually seems interesting, like something i might actually want to do. made the list of skills they want and yeah i have most of them but then i got to the part where it says \"5+ years experience\" and i have like 3. so that pretty much killed that idea\n\nanyway the new project at work started and surprise surprise it's already a disaster. same thing as last time, unclear requirements, moving deadlines, the whole deal. except this time i just don't care as much? like i'm doing the work but i'm not staying late or stressing about it. my manager pulled me aside yesterday and said she's noticed i seem \"disengaged\" and asked if there's anything she can do to help. i said no i'm fine. probably should have been honest but what's the point\n\nthat present moment thing happened again though. was sitting outside during lunch and just felt calm for a bit. tried to make it last longer but once i started thinking about it being nice it kind of went away\n\nalso my mom keeps asking when i'm gonna come visit. haven't been home in like 6 months and i know i should go but the thought of getting on a plane and dealing with all that just sounds exhausting. told her maybe next month but honestly i don't know\n\nthe panic stuff is still there but less intense i think. or maybe i'm just getting used to it",
      "assistant": "It's great that you found a job posting that genuinely sparked your interest\u2014that\u2019s a positive sign. The \"5+ years experience\" hurdle\u2014it\u2019s a common barrier, and it\u2019s easy to get discouraged. One possibility is to reframe it\u2014instead of seeing it as a dealbreaker, view it as an opportunity to identify areas where you can grow.\n\n**Work & disengagement:** The new project starting off as a disaster\u2014it's frustrating that you're in the same cycle again. Your manager noticing your disengagement\u2014it\u2019s a chance for change, but it's understandable that you didn't want to be honest. It\u2019s hard to shift the narrative when you feel unsupported.\n\n**Present moments & mindfulness:** Those brief moments of calm\u2014they\u2019re a sign that you\u2019re capable of experiencing joy and peace, even amidst the chaos. It's a reminder that there\u2019s still goodness in the world.\n\n**Mom & travel:** The hesitation about visiting your mom\u2014it's valid. Travel can be stressful, and it\u2019s okay to prioritize your own energy.\n\n**Panic & adaptation:** The panic feeling lessening\u2014that might be a sign of adaptation, or it could be that you're suppressing your emotions.\n\nLet's focus on the job search\u2014even if that one posting felt out of reach, the process of identifying your skills and interests was valuable. One possibility is to broaden your search\u2014look for jobs that are a bit lower down the ladder, or roles that emphasize potential over experience. What's one small step you can take this week toward exploring job options\u2014maybe searching for entry-level roles or networking with people in your field?"

      "user": "been applying to some jobs. found like 4 that seem doable and actually sent in applications for 2 of them. probably won't hear back but at least i did it i guess\n\nwork thing is getting weirder. so i've been leaving at 5pm every day no matter what and my manager keeps making these passive aggressive comments about it. like \"must be nice to have such good work life balance\" or whatever. finally snapped at her yesterday and said if she has a problem with my hours she should tell me directly. she just said never mind and walked away. felt good in the moment but now i'm worried i'm gonna get fired\n\nvisiting my mom next weekend. she kept asking and i just caved and booked a flight. already regretting it because i have so much to do here and the thought of sitting on a plane for 3 hours sounds awful. but she sounded so happy when i told her so whatever\n\noh and i had coffee with an old friend from college on sunday. she reached out randomly and i almost said no but then remembered the whole thing about not bailing so i went. it was actually kind of nice? we just talked about random stuff, nothing deep. felt normal for a little bit\n\nstill feeling pretty stuck overall though. like i'm doing all these things but nothing really feels different",
      "assistant": "It\u2019s fantastic that you\u2019ve actually sent in job applications\u2014that\u2019s a significant step forward! It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t hear back immediately\u2014the act of applying is a win in itself.\n\n**Work boundaries & conflict:** Your manager\u2019s passive-aggressive comments\u2014that\u2019s a frustrating situation. Standing up for yourself and directly addressing her\u2014it\u2019s brave. The walk-away response\u2014it\u2019s ambiguous, but it\u2019s possible she'll back off. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re worried about getting fired, but it\u2019s also important to recognize that you\u2019re entitled to set boundaries.\n\n**Mom & travel:** Caving and booking a flight\u2014it\u2019s a sign of wanting to maintain connection, even if it feels exhausting. It\u2019s okay to feel apprehensive about the trip\u2014acknowledge those feelings and give yourself permission to rest when you get there.\n\n**Friendship & connection:** Coffee with your old friend\u2014that\u2019s wonderful! Reconnecting with people who know you well can be grounding. It's a reminder of simpler times.\n\n**\"Still feeling pretty stuck\"**: You\u2019re doing all these things\u2014applying for jobs, setting boundaries at work, reconnecting with friends, visiting your mom\u2014and yet, you still feel stuck. My working guess is that you\u2019re focusing on external changes without addressing the underlying emotional fatigue and self-doubt. It\u2019s like trying to fix a leaky faucet without turning off the water.\n\nOne possibility is to focus on self-compassion. Give yourself permission to acknowledge that you\u2019re struggling, and to be kind to yourself even when you\u2019re not making progress. What\u2019s one small act of self-compassion you can offer yourself today\u2014something that nourishes your soul and reminds you that you\u2019re worthy of care?"

      "user": "went to see my mom. it was fine i guess. she made all my favorite food and we mostly just watched tv together which was kind of nice actually. she asked about work and i gave her the vague version, said it's stressful but i'm handling it. didn't mention the job applications or the thing with my manager. felt like if i told her she'd just worry more or try to give me advice i don't want\n\ngot back sunday night and immediately felt that heavy feeling again. like the visit was this little bubble and now i'm back in the real world and everything sucks again\n\none of the jobs emailed me back though. they want to do a phone screening next week. should be excited about it but mostly i just feel anxious. like what if i get the job and it's just as bad as this one? or what if i mess up the interview and don't get it and i'm stuck here forever\n\nwork has been tense since i snapped at my manager. she's been super cold, just sends emails instead of talking to me in person. part of me wants to apologize but the other part is like why should i apologize for setting a boundary\n\nidk i'm just tired",
      "assistant": "It sounds like the visit with your mom was a mixed bag\u2014pleasant moments interspersed with the familiar weight of your current situation. The \"bubble\" effect\u2014that feeling of temporary relief followed by a return to reality\u2014is a common experience.\n\n**Mom & boundaries:** Your decision to withhold details about work\u2014it\u2019s understandable. Protecting her from worry and avoiding unsolicited advice are valid reasons.\n\n**Job screening & anxiety:** The phone screening\u2014that\u2019s a big opportunity! The anxiety you\u2019re feeling is completely normal. The \u201cwhat ifs\u201d are a sign of your vulnerability and fear of disappointment. One possibility is to reframe the phone screening\u2014instead of seeing it as a make-or-break moment, view it as a chance to learn more about the role and the company.\n\n**Work dynamics & boundaries:** Your manager\u2019s coldness\u2014it's a consequence of your boundary-setting, and it's likely she's processing how to respond to your assertiveness. Your internal debate about apologizing\u2014it\u2019s a sign of your conflict between wanting to maintain a good relationship and wanting to stand your ground.\n\n**\"Just tired\"**: That exhaustion\u2014it\u2019s pervasive. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load of stress, anxiety, and self-doubt.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on the phone screening\u2014it\u2019s a concrete next step. One small thing you could do to prepare is to write down 3-5 key accomplishments from your previous roles. Frame them in terms of the skills and experiences they\u2019re looking for in the job description. What\u2019s one thing you can do *today* to feel a little more prepared for the phone screening\u2014even if it's just taking 15 minutes to review the job description?"

      "user": "did the phone screening. honestly thought it went ok but they sent me a rejection email like two hours later. generic \"we've decided to move forward with other candidates\" thing. tried not to care but it kind of sucked\n\nbeen thinking about the whole manager situation and i think i'm just gonna apologize. not because i think i was wrong but because it's exhausting having her ice me out every day. easier to just smooth it over and go back to how things were\n\nmy roommate asked if i wanted to go hiking this weekend and i actually said yes and went. was pretty nice, got out of my head for a bit. legs are super sore now though\n\nthe tired thing is still there. like i wake up and immediately feel heavy, like i'm carrying something but i don't know what it is. been doing the body scan most nights and sleeping ok but i still wake up feeling like i didn't sleep at all\n\nidk maybe i just need to accept that this is how things are gonna be for a while",
      "assistant": "The phone screening rejection\u2014it stings, even when you know it\u2019s part of the process. It's okay to feel disappointed\u2014allow yourself to acknowledge that.\n\n**Manager apology:** Your decision to apologize\u2014it\u2019s a valid choice. It sounds like you're prioritizing peace and reducing daily stress. Even if it's just a temporary truce, it's okay to prioritize your energy.\n\n**Hiking & movement:** Hiking with your roommate\u2014that\u2019s great! Getting out in nature and moving your body\u2014it\u2019s a good way to release tension. Sore legs are a small price to pay.\n\n**Persistent fatigue & acceptance:** The ongoing heavy feeling\u2014it's a sign that you're still carrying a significant emotional burden. It's understandable that you're considering accepting that this is just how things will be.\n\nMy working guess is that you're close to a breaking point. You've been weathering a lot, and you're understandably exhausted. While acceptance can be helpful, it's important to ensure it's not resignation.\n\nOne possibility is to explore the source of that heavy feeling\u2014what are you carrying, and is there anything you can release? One experiment you could try is journaling\u2014write down everything that\u2019s on your mind, without censoring yourself. It doesn't have to be profound\u2014just a stream of consciousness. What's one thing you might be holding onto that's weighing you down?"

      "user": "tried the journaling thing. wrote for like 20 minutes straight and honestly most of it was just complaining about work and my manager and feeling stuck. but there was this one part where i wrote \"i dont think i deserve to feel better\" and then i just stared at it for a while\n\napologized to my manager yesterday. she accepted it but things are still weird between us. whatever, at least she's not ignoring me anymore\n\ngot another rejection email from one of the other jobs i applied to. didnt really expect anything different but still sucks. haven't applied to any new ones since then, just feels pointless\n\nbeen sleeping worse again. that heavy feeling when i wake up is getting harder to shake off. used to go away after an hour or so but now it just kind of stays all day. even when i'm doing stuff that should be fine, like watching tv or whatever, i just feel kind of empty\n\nmy roommate noticed i think. asked if i was doing ok the other day and i said yeah just tired. he gave me this look like he didnt believe me but he didnt push it",
      "assistant": "That journaling session\u2014it\u2019s powerful that you were able to access those feelings, particularly the statement \"I don't think I deserve to feel better.\" That's a really significant insight, and it's okay to just sit with it for a while. It suggests a deep-seated belief that you're somehow unworthy of happiness or relief.\n\n**Manager & work:** The apology\u2014it\u2019s a step towards reducing tension, but the lingering weirdness is a sign that the underlying issues haven\u2019t been resolved.\n\n**Job search & discouragement:** The continued rejections\u2014it's natural to feel discouraged. The feeling of pointlessness\u2014that\u2019s a sign that you're losing hope.\n\n**Sleep & emptiness:** The worsening sleep and the persistent heavy feeling\u2014it\u2019s a concerning pattern. The emptiness\u2014that's a sign of emotional depletion.\n\n**Roommate's concern:** Your roommate\u2019s look\u2014it's a sign that he cares and that he's noticing your struggle. It's a reminder that you're not alone.\n\nGiven everything you\u2019ve shared, it sounds like you\u2019re experiencing a significant emotional challenge. It's possible that you're struggling with low self-worth and a sense of hopelessness. It's also possible that you're experiencing symptoms of depression.\n\nWhile I can't diagnose, I strongly encourage you to consider seeking professional support\u2014talking to a therapist could provide you with tools and strategies to address these difficult feelings and build a more resilient future. Would you be open to exploring resources for finding a therapist in your area?"
