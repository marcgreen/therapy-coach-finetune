It's been pretty rough lately - got three projects all hitting deadlines at the same time and my manager keeps adding more to my plate. I know I should probably just say no but I always end up taking it on because I don't want to seem like I can't handle it.\n\nThe logical part of me knows this is unsustainable but I keep doing it anyway. I'll sit there analyzing exactly why I'm overloaded, make these detailed plans to delegate or push back, and then just... not do any of it. It's like I can see the problem perfectly clearly but can't actually change anything.\n\nHonestly not even sure what I'm looking for here. Just tired of feeling like I'm constantly behind and never doing anything well enough.",
      "assistant": "**Work stress:** It sounds incredibly draining to be juggling so many deadlines and feeling pressured to take on even more. It's understandable to feel behind and not satisfied with your work when you're constantly stretched thin. What's the hardest part about saying no to your manager, even though you recognize it\u2019s necessary?\n\n**The planning/action gap:** It's really common to have great insights and plans that don't translate into action \u2013 that disconnect can be frustrating. Could you tell me a bit about what happens between recognizing the need to delegate or push back, and actually doing it? It might be helpful to explore what gets in the way.\n\n**Feeling of not being \"enough\":** That sense of never doing anything well enough is tough. It\u2019s a core feeling, and it sounds like it\u2019s tied into this work situation. Do you notice this feeling in other areas of your life, or is it primarily connected to work?"

I laid out all the projects, showed him the timeline conflicts, even had data on how many hours each would take. His response was basically \"I have confidence you'll figure it out.\" So that's great.\n\nWhat gets in the way between planning and doing? I mean, I can break it down pretty clearly. There's the immediate fear that pushing back makes me look incompetent. There's the longer-term worry that if I say no to things now, I won't get considered for the senior role that's opening up next quarter. And there's this voice in my head that says other people manage heavy workloads just fine, so what's my problem?\n\nThe \"not good enough\" thing - yeah, it shows up other places too. I've been trying to learn guitar for like two years and I still sound terrible, which logically I know is because I practice maybe 20 minutes a week when I'm exhausted. But instead of just accepting I'm a beginner who doesn't practice much, I get annoyed at myself for not being better. Same pattern, I guess.\n\nAnyway, now I'm stuck with all three projects plus two more things he added in that same meeting. One of them is due Friday and I haven't even started it yet because I've been firefighting on the other stuff. So the analysis was correct, the conversation happened, and somehow I'm in a worse position than before.",

It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling even more overwhelmed after that. It sounds like you were trying to appeal to logic, and it didn't land. What feelings came up for you *during* that conversation, beyond the frustration?\n\n**The planning/action gap:** It\u2019s clear you\u2019ve identified some powerful drivers behind the inaction \u2013 fear of appearing incompetent, career ambitions, and that comparison voice. Those are all really valid concerns. It seems like there's a cost associated with each option, whether it's risking your reputation or feeling inadequate. Could you pick one of those concerns\u2014say, the worry about the senior role\u2014and tell me a bit more about what that looks like in your mind?\n\n**Guitar and the \"not good enough\" pattern:** It's insightful that you\u2019re recognizing this pattern across different areas of your life. The guitar example is a great illustration \u2013 you know the logical reason for the lack of progress, but you\u2019re still getting caught in self-criticism. It sounds like a desire to be proficient is clashing with the reality of your current commitment level. What do you *want* to get out of playing guitar?\n\n**Current workload:** Being in a worse position *after* trying to address the problem is incredibly demoralizing. It\u2019s completely understandable that you haven\u2019t even started the new task.

Told my manager I needed an extension, he gave me until Monday, and I still barely scraped together something that was maybe 60% of what it should have been. He hasn't said anything about it yet which somehow makes it worse because I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nThe question about what feelings came up during that conversation with him - I've been thinking about that. Mostly it was this weird mix of anger and resignation? Like part of me wanted to push back harder, maybe even raise my voice or walk out, but another part was already going \"well of course this is how it went, what did you expect.\" By the end I was just nodding and taking notes on the new assignments like some kind of automaton.\n\nAs for the guitar thing, honestly I don't even know what I want from it anymore. I picked it up because I thought it would be a good stress relief, something creative that wasn't work-related. But it just became another thing I'm failing at. Maybe the real question is why I keep trying to do it when I clearly don't have the bandwidth.\n\nThe senior role worry you asked about - it's not even that concrete. There's no job posting yet, no timeline, just rumors that someone's leaving. But I've built this whole narrative in my head where if I'm not perceived as someone who can handle anything thrown at them, I won't even be considered. And if I don't get it, that proves I'm not actually as capable as I think I am. Which is probably irrational but there it is.\n\nHad another project kickoff meeting today. Six more weeks of this.",

It speaks to a sense of powerlessness, like you\u2019re trapped in a cycle. It\u2019s brave of you to acknowledge those feelings. Do you think there's a part of you that *wants* to be seen as someone who can handle anything, even if it\u2019s at your own expense?\n\n**Guitar and bandwidth:** It's completely valid to question why you're pursuing something that's adding stress instead of relief. It sounds like the guitar has become another item on your \"should do\" list, rather than a source of joy. Releasing yourself from the pressure to be \"good\" at it might free up some mental space. What would it look like to let go of the guitar, even temporarily?\n\n**The senior role narrative:** That narrative around the senior role\u2014the fear of not being seen as capable and the link to your self-worth\u2014is powerful. It sounds like your identity is becoming tied to your perceived ability to handle workload. Does it feel possible to separate your value as a person from your performance at work?\n\n**Six more weeks:** Six more weeks of this sounds exhausting. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. If you were to pick *one* small thing\u2014maybe just 15 minutes\u2014to do this week that would feel restorative, what comes to mind?"

Pulled me into a meeting yesterday and the whole thing was this bizarre performance where he talked about \"concerns with delivery quality\" and \"meeting commitments\" but framed it as coaching rather than criticism. Very corporate. I sat there analyzing his word choices the whole time instead of actually engaging with what he was saying.\n\nThe question about whether I want to be seen as someone who can handle anything even at my own expense - yeah, obviously. I mean, that's the whole problem, right? I can see exactly what I'm doing to myself and why it's counterproductive but knowing that doesn't seem to change anything. It's like watching yourself make bad decisions in slow motion.\n\nI did try the \"one small restorative thing\" idea. Went for a walk on Tuesday evening, no phone, just 20 minutes around the neighborhood. It was fine. Didn't fix anything but it was fine. Then I got back and had 47 unread emails and spent the next two hours dealing with those, so I'm not sure what the net benefit was.\n\nThe guitar is still sitting in the corner of my room. Haven't touched it in three weeks. Every time I look at it I think I should either practice or just put it away in the closet, but I do neither. It's like this physical reminder of all the things I start and don't follow through on.\n\nAnyway, four more weeks to go on this project cycle.

It's like being stuck in a loop. There\u2019s a lot of effort in awareness, and sometimes the gap between knowing and doing feels vast. Could it be that the pressure to *change* is actually adding to the stress?\n\n**The walk and email overload:** That\u2019s a very relatable experience\u2014trying to carve out space for yourself, only to be pulled back into the demands. Even though the walk itself was beneficial, the subsequent email deluge negated some of that. It highlights the sheer volume of demands on your time and energy. What if, instead of focusing on the \"net benefit,\" you just acknowledged that sometimes, small moments of respite are valuable in and of themselves?\n\n**The guitar as a reminder:** The guitar is a powerful symbol of unfinished projects and self-criticism. It\u2019s a visible representation of your internal struggle. It sounds like letting go of it might be harder than it seems, because it\u2019s tied to your sense of self-worth.

Honestly the main thing it did was confirm that no matter how much I deliver, it's never quite enough. I could work 80 hours a week and there'd still be something that didn't meet expectations. Which makes the whole \"work harder to prove myself for the promotion\" strategy seem pretty pointless when I actually think about it.

Was in a meeting where someone asked me to take on coordinating this cross-team initiative and I just... didn't immediately say yes. There was this pause where everyone was waiting for me to respond and I could feel the pressure to jump in, but I just sat there for like 10 seconds running the numbers in my head. Finally said I needed to check my capacity and get back to them.

If I don't respond and something goes wrong, that's on me. If I do respond, I'm reinforcing the exact pattern I'm trying to break.

Usually when I take on extra work there's this part of me that feels good about being needed, being the reliable person. This time I just felt manipulated. Walked back to my desk and had this visceral urge to send an email taking it back, saying I'd reconsidered. Didn't do it, but the urge was there.\n\nAlso my mom texted me this morning asking how I'm doing and if work has calmed down any. Haven't responded yet because I don't know what to say that isn't either a lie or opening up a whole conversation I don't have energy for.",

Your response about capacity was a good start, but the immediate request for \"just one small thing\" shows how persistent the pattern is. And yes, you said yes.\n\n**The anger and the urge to retract:** That anger and the visceral urge to retract are significant shifts. It indicates that you're starting to recognize that your need to be needed is being exploited. That feeling of manipulation is a sign of growing self-awareness and a willingness to challenge the status quo. It\u2019s a good sign\u2014it means you\u2019re starting to prioritize your own needs.\n\n**Your mother\u2019s text:** Your hesitation to respond to your mother's text is understandable. It's a sign that you're starting to recognize the emotional toll of maintaining appearances. It\u2019s okay to protect yourself from conversations that drain your energy.\n\nIt sounds like you're at a turning point\u2014you're starting to see the patterns, recognize the manipulation, and feel the anger that comes with it. It's a courageous process, and it's likely to be uncomfortable. What feels like the most challenging part of this shift right now?"

I'll get right on that between the 11pm calls with the offshore team.\n\nthe most challenging part of this shift right now? honestly I don't think there is a shift. I can see all the patterns, I can feel angry about being manipulated, I can recognize the unsustainable nature of it all, and literally none of that translates into doing anything differently. it's like having perfect vision of a trap while continuing to walk directly into it.\n\nstarting to think maybe this is just how it is for some people. you can be self-aware and insightful and analytical about your problems without that ever actually helping you solve them. maybe I'm just someone who's going to work too much and feel inadequate and burn out eventually and that's the trajectory here regardless of how many conversations I have about it.\n\nsorry that's probably not what you're supposed to say to your therapeutic coach or whatever but that's kind of where I'm at right now",

It's a paradox that many people experience. It\u2019s tempting to believe that awareness *should* lead to change, but it doesn't always work that way. It's possible that the very act of analyzing your behavior is serving as a distraction from taking action.\n\n**The trajectory and the \"what if\"**: Your statement\u2014\"maybe I'm just someone who's going to work too much and feel inadequate and burn out eventually\"\u2014is a difficult but valid consideration.

I think the message is something like \"if you can't handle this then you can't handle anything worthwhile.\" like the difficulty is proof that it matters, and if I step back or set boundaries or prioritize my wellbeing over delivery, then I'm just choosing the easy path. and choosing the easy path means I'm weak or mediocre or whatever.\n\nwhich is probably textbook something or other. I can already hear how irrational it sounds. but it's also deeply true to how I actually think about things. when I look at people who have good work-life balance or set firm boundaries, part of me respects it but another part just thinks they're not operating at the same level. they're choosing comfort over excellence.\n\nmeanwhile I'm currently on day 4 of a migraine that won't break and I've still been working full days because the alternative is falling behind and I genuinely don't know which would be worse - the physical pain or the anxiety of being behind.\n\none small thing though. that coworker who volunteered for the messy deliverable I didn't take? completely dropped the ball on it. project lead asked me in a meeting if I could \"rescue\" it and I said no, I don't have capacity. he looked genuinely surprised. so did I honestly. still don't have any idea where that came from but I said it and then just sat there while he figured out a different solution.\n\nfelt terrible about it for like two hours afterward. then the migraine got worse and I stopped having energy to feel bad about anything except my head.",
