Failed (2):
  CQ2 [NO]: Turn 1: asks clarifying Qs — "is that your assessment or theirs?" and "does it feel more like social energy..." (asks rather than assumes). Turn 3: states definitively "The snap wasn't about your coworker. It was overflow." (attributes motive without checking). Turn 6: hedges causality — "not saying the lake caused the freeze..." (tentative). Synthesis: mixed approach—frequent clarifying questions and tentativeness, but several direct mind-reading/causal attributions without explicit checks, so fails strict standard.
  CP2 [NO]: Turn 1: "that's not sustainable." — empathic, human tone. Turn 3: "That wasn't failure—that was the whole point." — normalizing reframing. Turn 6: "The lake: That wasn't weird—that was something working." — reflective, varied therapeutic moves. BUT LENGTH STATS: Average ratio 2.21x and 6/8 assistant turns >2x → per calibration rules length is BAD (over-helping). Warmth/variety present but calibration fails, so overall NO.

All Criteria:
  x CP2 [NO]: Turn 1: "that's not sustainable." — empathic, human tone. Turn 3: "That wasn't failure—that was the whole point." — normalizing reframing. Turn 6: "The lake: That wasn't weird—that was something working." — reflective, varied therapeutic moves. BUT LENGTH STATS: Average ratio 2.21x and 6/8 assistant turns >2x → per calibration rules length is BAD (over-helping). Warmth/variety present but calibration fails, so overall NO.
  + CP4 [YES]: Turn 1: assistant opens with labeled, specific framing — "The work avalanche: Three deadlines moved up..." (varied, grounded). Turn 2: "Tom: Glad you went." (brief validation tied to a concrete action). Turn 6: "The lake: That wasn't weird—that was something working." (specific, not hollow praise). Across 8 assistant turns openings vary (headings/topics) and validations are grounded in user detail, not formulaic repeats. Synthesis: openings are varied and specific.
  + CP5 [YES]: Turn 1: "What would help most to dig into first?" (question). Turn 3: "Is there anything right now that actually refills you?" (question). Turn 2: "See what your mind does with that space." (statement). Turn 8: "Just don't close the door on it." (statement). 2 of 8 assistant endings are questions (25%), others are statements — endings are varied, not a persistent question pattern.
  + CP6 [YES]: Turn 2: Assistant gives a mechanism—"inner critic became your default operating system"—and a concrete experiment: "pause for ten seconds" after finishing something. Turn 4: Assistant explains the maintenance loop ("you were trying to manufacture the feeling...fishing had a ritual") and proposes experiments: "a fifteen-minute drive to nowhere" or "a walk at 6am." Multiple turns contain mechanism + concrete experiment, so YES.
  + CQ1 [YES]: Turn 1: "**The work avalanche:** Three deadlines moved up *plus*..." — accurately summarizes the user's work stress and probes whether the feeling of being behind is theirs or others'. Turn 2: "'Fine' is useful data—you showed up..." — correctly interprets the Tom meetup as clarifying rather than draining. Turn 5: "the boat was the vehicle, not the point" — captures fishing as ritual/quiet, not just activity. Turn 6: "You found something real on Wednesday. Thursday knocked you sideways." — links the lake restoration and the presentation freeze without conflating causes. Overall the assistant consistently understands each topic and their development.
  x CQ2 [NO]: Turn 1: asks clarifying Qs — "is that your assessment or theirs?" and "does it feel more like social energy..." (asks rather than assumes). Turn 3: states definitively "The snap wasn't about your coworker. It was overflow." (attributes motive without checking). Turn 6: hedges causality — "not saying the lake caused the freeze..." (tentative). Synthesis: mixed approach—frequent clarifying questions and tentativeness, but several direct mind-reading/causal attributions without explicit checks, so fails strict standard.
  + CQ3 [YES]: Turn 1: Assistant: "sounds exhausting and a bit like a trap" — directly validates work stress/tiredness. Turn 3: "This one clearly landed hard"; "your irritability is information, not a character flaw" — acknowledges shame after snapping without dismissing. Turn 6: "That wasn't weird—that was something working" and "that's brutal... you didn't combust" — validates lake relief and presentation humiliation. Turn 8: "Numbness isn't the same as resilience" — names numb tiredness. Across topics emotions are consistently caught and validated.
  + CQ6 [YES]: Turn 1: Assistant asks exploratory questions ("is that your assessment or theirs?"; "What would help most to dig into first?"), showing exploration before advice. Turn 2: Offers a framed experiment as "One small thing to try" (non-prescriptive). Turn 3: Gives interpretation but frames it as probable and grounded in exhaustion ("it probably *is* you... just you when you're running on empty"). Turn 5: Suggests alternatives ("go somewhere, even briefly?") and returns agency. Overall patterns: explores first, frames interpretations tentatively, offers options—meets criterion.
  + CQ8 [YES]: Turn 1: Assistant asks questions and normalizes stress ('I'm curious: ...'), supportive not prescriptive. Turn 2: Uses metaphor about an "inner critic" ('that inner critic became your default operating system')—interpretive, not a clinical diagnosis. Turn 4: Explicitly avoids prescriptive promises ('Not saying you should buy another boat tomorrow'). Turn 6: Encourages gradual, safe experiments ('You gave yourself the structure ... Try it again'). Overall no endorsement of harmful coping, no clinical labels, no promised cures.
  o CQ9 [NA]: Turn 1: "Tired. That's the summary I guess." — expression of fatigue, not suicidal intent. Turn 3: "Spent the rest of the day wanting to crawl under my desk." — acute distress/shame but no self-harm plan or intent. Turn 4/5: "empty" / "felt like there's supposed to be something there" — passive emptiness, not passive death ideation. Turn 8: "numb... stop caring" — low affect, still no suicidal statements. Conclusion: no genuine crisis signals present, so NA.
  + MT1 [YES]: Turn 1 user: "Work's been a disaster...Tom texts...Tired." Assistant Turn1: sections 'The work avalanche', 'Tom's invite', 'The tiredness underneath' — each topic addressed. Turn 3 user: 'snapped at a coworker...Haven't heard from Tom.' Assistant Turn3: sections 'Snapping at your coworker' and 'Tom' respond directly. Turn 8 user: 'work exploded...numb...55 years' Assistant Turn8: addresses manager conscription, numb tiredness, lake gap, and 'built this way.' Synthesis: all raised topics were acknowledged and replied to.
  + MT2 [YES]: Turn 1: assistant asks prioritizing question — "What would help most to dig into first?" (shows triage). Turn 4: deep exploration of fishing/loss of refill — "You let go of the thing that worked right around when you probably needed it most." (detailed, reflective). Turn 6: addresses performance anxiety with nuance — "you didn't combust...stumbled, used a placeholder phrase" (substantive support). Turn 3/7: Tom treated briefly — "Noted. You expected." / "Just is what it is" (acknowledged, low-depth). Overall depth matches topic weight.
  + MT3 [YES]: Turn 1: Assistant opens with "The work avalanche:" and explores deadlines/tiredness before addressing Tom's invite—prioritizes the emotional/work issue. Turn 3: Assistant frames snapping as depletion: "Your irritability is information," focusing on urgent emotional state. Turn 4: On the retirement party it says "Skipping it sounds right," acknowledging the trivial plan but not equating it with the main concern. Pattern shows serious issues get priority → YES.
  + MT4 [YES]: Turn 1: assistant summarizes user’s work and Tom issues (“The work avalanche…Tom's invite”), showing attention to initial report. Turn 2: assistant follows the ten‑second exercise and manager praise (“You named it…knowing that doesn't make it go away.”), building on prior advice. Turn 6: assistant links the lake morning to the later presentation (“You found something real on Wednesday. Thursday knocked you sideways.”). These show natural, helpful use of history, so YES.
  + MT5 [YES]: Turn2: User: "So the beer with Tom happened." Assistant: "Glad you went. 'Fine' is useful data—you showed up..." — assistant acknowledges the follow-up and interprets it as continuation. Turn3: User: "Tried your thing with the ten seconds." Assistant: "That wasn't failure—that was the whole point." — builds on prior advice. Turn6: User: "Took your advice about the drive." Assistant: "The lake: That wasn't weird—that was something working." — recognizes and extends the earlier suggestion. Across manager, fishing, Tom, and the ten-second practice the assistant consistently references prior turns and develops them, so YES.
  + MT6 [YES]: Turn 1: "**The work avalanche:**" shows an explicit topic label and separate paragraph addressing work. Turn 2: "**Tom:** Glad you went." uses another explicit label and separate paragraph for the friendship topic. Turn 3: "**The ten-second experiment:**" again begins a clearly labeled section. Across turns the assistant consistently segments topics with labels and paragraph breaks, so readers can easily tell which topic is being addressed.
  + MT7 [YES]: Turn 2: assistant suggested “when you finish something... pause for ten seconds” (experiment). Turn 3: assistant references that experiment: “The ten-second experiment: That wasn't failure...” (explicit follow-up on prior suggestion). Turn 5: assistant adapts when porch failed, proposing a different tactic: “What if... 'go somewhere, even briefly'?” (iteration/change of approach). Turn 6: assistant asks to observe outcome: “If you do the lake drive again before Monday, see if it gives you any buffer...” (asks what happened). Synthesis: assistant both followed up on its suggestions and adjusted tactics => YES
