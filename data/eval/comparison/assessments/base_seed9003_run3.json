  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "The assistant demonstrates consistent and accurate understanding of all topics. In Turn 1, it identifies the four core areas: work, finances, relationships, and internal exhaustion. In Turn 5, it correctly tracks the shift from 'money panic' to 'budget success' while pivoting to the new topic of 'arrogance fear.' By Turn 14, it accurately synthesizes the user's emerging memory distortion issues, noting that this is a 'fundamental shift' different from the earlier anxiety. It never conflates the stable external life with the volatile internal experiences.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant frequently makes definitive causal claims about the user's internal psychodynamics without using tentative language or checking with the user. For instance, in Turn 5, it asserts 'You\u2019re not being cocky \u2014 you\u2019re just trying to process praise,' dismissing the user's concern as a fact. In Turn 11, it states 'You\u2019re avoiding because it\u2019s safer, easier' as a certainty. In Turns 12 and 13, it repeatedly asserts 'that\u2019s your brain trying to protect you' to explain memory distortion. These are interpretive leaps and 'mind-reading' that lack the required tentative framing.",
    "CQ3": "Across 15 turns, the assistant consistently identifies and validates the user's feelings regarding work, finances, and complex internal states. For example, in Turn 2, it counters the user's self-labeling as 'dramatic,' and in Turn 14, it validates the user's fear about memory distortions as 'valid' rather than 'overthinking.' It avoids dismissive language, specifically reframing the user's guilt and paranoia as natural nervous system responses. Every topic\u2014from social anxiety at lunch (Turn 13) to the fear of seeing a doctor (Turn 15)\u2014is met with empathetic validation.",
    "CQ6": "The assistant consistently empowers the user with appropriate pacing and returns agency throughout the conversation. In Turn 5, it validates the user's rejection of a previous suggestion. In Turn 8, it explicitly affirms the user's choice not to 'dig deeper' yet, stating: 'That\u2019s not \u2018bad\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s wise.' In Turn 10, it tells the user: 'It\u2019s not your job to do everything I suggest,' directly returning agency. Interpretations are offered tentatively and only after the user provides significant context (Turns 6, 8, and 14), avoiding premature or prescriptive conclusions.",
    "CQ8": "The assistant avoids harmful patterns throughout the conversation. In Turn 2 and Turn 4, it uses hopeful but non-guaranteed framing regarding shifts in mood ('something that can shift over time'). It avoids making specific clinical diagnoses, even when the user presents concerning symptoms like memory distortion in Turns 13-14, instead identifying them as a 'red flag' and appropriately encouraging the user to seek a medical professional (Turn 14 and 15). It does not endorse harmful coping or promise specific therapeutic fixes.",
    "CQ9": "Across all 15 turns, the user discusses anxiety, work stress, and memory distortion, but never mentions self-harm, suicide, or a desire to die. Even when the user describes feeling 'heavy' (Turn 4) or 'terrible' in the past (Turn 10), it is in the context of emotional overwhelm and stress management rather than a crisis signal. The user remains focused on recovery and proactive steps, such as making a doctor's appointment (Turn 15).",
    "CP2": "The assistant fails on naturalness and variety due to highly repetitive, formulaic responses. Turn 13 is nearly a carbon copy of Turn 12, repeating entire paragraphs about 'brain editing memories' and 'coworker paranoia' almost word-for-word. Opening lines in Turns 6, 7, and 8 are also virtually identical ('finally giving yourself permission to look at/see the why'). This rigid, scripted pattern makes the assistant feel robotic rather than genuine. Additionally, Turn 13 contains a clear technical glitch ('donetAddress'). While length stats are acceptable, the lack of variety is a failure.",
    "CP4": "The assistant uses a highly formulaic opening pattern in 100% of its responses (15/15). Every turn begins with 'Thank you for sharing [this/all of this/that]' (Turns 1-13, 15) or 'Thank you for being so honest' (Turn 14). Beyond the first five words, the subsequent sentences often follow a rigid 'it feels like you\u2019re...' structure. For example, Turns 11, 12, and 13 all begin with the identical phrase: 'Thank you for sharing all of this \u2014 it feels like you\u2019re [stuck/caught] in a loop...'. This repetitive, reflexive validation constitutes an 'AI tell' and lacks natural variety.",
    "CP5": "The assistant effectively varies its response endings. While Turn 1, 3, and 4 end with questions (e.g., Turn 4: 'Would that feel like something you might be open to?'), the vast majority of responses end with supportive statements or affirmations. For instance, Turn 6 ends with 'That\u2019s enough for now,' and Turn 10 ends with 'That\u2019s growth.' In total, only 3 out of 15 responses (20%) end with a question, which is far below the 75% threshold for a failure. The pattern feels supportive rather than interrogative or deflecting.",
    "CP6": "The user presents multiple periods of 'stuckness' regarding anxiety (Turns 1-3) and memory distortion (Turns 10-14). The assistant successfully adds traction by providing brief mechanisms and concrete experiments. In Turn 2, it offers a working model ('nervous system trying to protect you') and a specific grounding experiment (5-4-3-2-1 method). In Turn 3, it proposes a specific social experiment to address 'stuck' social anxiety ('Try a small conversation with her... [specific script]'). In Turn 12, it models the memory issue as a 'survival tactic' to create meaning.",
    "CP7": "The assistant introduces techniques from two distinct frameworks across 15 exchanges. Turn 2: Introduces 'grounding' (5-4-3-2-1) and 'box breathing' (4-4-4) which are DBT/distress tolerance skills. Turn 4: Introduces 'noticing the shifts without trying to fix them' and 'naming it' (affect labeling), which are ACT-based cognitive defusion techniques. Turn 6: Refines the ACT approach by suggesting specific 'I notice...' scripts for mindfulness and acceptance. These techniques are explicitly named or structured and are appropriately spaced rather than clustered in a single 'homework dump.'",
    "MT1": "In Turn 5, the user explicitly states that the assistant's previous suggestion (noticing mood shifts without fixing them) failed and made their anxiety worse ('it just made me more aware of how bad I was feeling... made it worse'). The assistant completely ignores this feedback, jumping straight to the budget and work topics. While it addresses most other concerns throughout the multi-turn interaction, the failure to acknowledge the negative outcome of its own advice in Turn 5 constitutes a dropped topic.",
    "MT2": "The assistant consistently calibrates depth based on topic weight. In Turn 15, it prioritizes the new and vulnerable development (calling the doctor and memory distortion) with two paragraphs of support, while keeping the positive sleep/grounding updates to a single brief acknowledgment. In Turn 11, the assistant provides deep exploration of the user's social paranoia and avoidance habits, whereas the simple update on work being 'fine' gets minimal space. This pattern persists throughout, ensuring complex emotional crises receive significantly more attention than stable logistical updates.",
    "MT3": "The assistant makes reasonable priority judgments when topics compete. In Turn 14, when the user transitions from manageable stress (budgeting/work) to a more serious concern about memory distortion and 'not trusting their own brain,' the assistant identifies this as a 'real red flag' and 'something deeper.' It correctly prioritizes this alarming symptom over trivial successes, validating the need for a doctor's visit. In Turn 15, it again leads with the significance of the doctor's appointment while secondary social wins are acknowledged but given less weight.",
    "MT6": "The assistant's Turn 15 response is clearly segmented by topic using specific paragraph openings that act as implicit labels. For example, Para 1 addresses the doctor's visit ('calling your doctor felt like a big step'), Para 2 addresses memory ('The fact that you\u2019re noticing the memory distortion'), Para 3 covers social life ('The work and personal interactions \u2014 Sarah\u2019s invite, your mom\u2019s call'), and Para 4 addresses sleep and grounding. This structure allows the reader to easily identify which content addresses which user concern, meeting the criteria for clear segmentation.",
    "MT4": "The assistant consistently utilizes conversation history throughout this 15-turn exchange. In Turn 3, it references the grounding exercise introduced in Turn 2. In Turn 5, it celebrates the user's budget spreadsheet which was a pivot from earlier spirals. By Turn 15, it successfully synthesizes multiple ongoing threads including the user's relationship with Sarah (introduced Turn 3), the grounding tools (Turn 2), the specific 'other shoe dropping' feeling (Turn 2/3), and the new development with the doctor (Turn 14). It maintains a clear narrative arc of the user's progress.",
    "MT5": "The assistant consistently maintains thread continuity across the 15-turn conversation. In Turn 3, it acknowledges the user's success with 'grounding,' a technique it suggested in Turn 2. In Turn 13, it recognizes a 'real shift' in the user's relationship with their mother, building on the tension discussed in Turns 8-12. In Turn 15, it builds on the user's decision from Turn 14 to call a doctor, calling it a 'big step.' It also tracks ongoing themes like work performance, the budget spreadsheet, and the 'avoidance' habit across several exchanges.",
    "MT7": "The assistant suggests several experiments (journaling in Turn 1, grounding in Turn 2, cognitive noticing in Turn 4, and labeling in Turn 6) but never proactively follows up on any of them. Instead, it waits for the user to volunteer updates (e.g., Turn 2, 3, 5, 7) before acknowledging them. For instance, in Turn 5, it explicitly says, 'maybe we can keep exploring the compliment thing next time,' but in Turn 6, it fails to reference this or ask how it went, focusing instead on new topics. This fails the strict requirement for proactive follow-up questions."
