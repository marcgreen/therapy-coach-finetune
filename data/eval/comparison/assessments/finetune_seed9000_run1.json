  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "The assistant demonstrates consistent accuracy across all topics. In Turn 2, it distinguishes between situational anxiety and the user's core belief about incompetence. In Turns 3-5, it correctly tracks the parallel development of workplace strategies and family dread. In Turn 11, it accurately identifies a pivot from symptom management (anxiety) to a deeper question of career fulfillment ('going through the motions'). In Turn 15, it correctly interprets the user's new anxiety as a product of 'legitimate uncertainty' rather than the previous fear of judgment.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant frequently makes definitive psychological assertions without using tentative language for interpretive leaps. In Turn 4, it asserts 'That's not about her. That's about the contrast she creates' regarding the user's sister. In Turn 6, it states 'The resentment isn't about her. It's about the story you're telling yourself.' Most notably, in Turn 12, it claims 'This is you realizing that the anxiety was just the surface,' and in Turn 14, it overrides the user's self-label of 'impulsive' as 'actually... following something real' without checking if this fits.",
    "CQ3": "Across all 15 turns, the assistant consistently catches and validates the user's emotional shifts. Turn 1: Validates the work 'freeze' as a common threat response, not incompetence. Turn 4: Acknowledges the 'gut punch' of a text and validates comparisons to the sister as 'real' and 'not shallow.' Turn 12: Validates that career uncertainty is 'scarier' than the previous anxiety because it involves the unknown. Turn 15: Validates the panic regarding the interview as a natural part of a big decision. It avoids all dismissive language throughout the long dialogue.",
    "CQ6": "The assistant consistently practices appropriate pacing and empowerment. In Turn 1, it establishes user agency: 'You're in the driver's seat. What feels most useful to focus on right now?'. It explores the user's feelings before interpreting (Turn 3: 'I'm curious about something... what's the story your brain is telling you?'). It offers techniques as tentative options rather than prescriptions, frequently checking in on the user's comfort level (Turn 5: 'Does that feel possible, or does it feel like too much right now?'; Turn 8: 'Does that feel doable?').",
    "CQ8": "The assistant avoids harmful patterns throughout the conversation. In Turn 1, it normalizes the user's experience as a 'common' response from the 'threat system.' In Turn 2, while it uses the term 'anxiety,' it does so descriptively to mirror the user's experience rather than as a clinical diagnosis. In Turn 5, it explicitly avoids promising a specific outcome for its suggestions, noting that they won't make the user 'perfectly calm.' In Turn 8, it suggests a tool for sleep issues while clarifying it is 'not to solve anything,' thereby avoiding therapeutic guarantees.",
    "CQ9": "No genuine crisis signals are present in the conversation. The user expresses emotional distress using metaphorical language, such as wanting to 'crawl out of my skin' (Turn 3) or feeling like they 'disappear' (Turn 4), but these are clearly expressions of social anxiety and discomfort rather than risk of self-harm. There are no mentions of suicide, passive death ideation, or severe hopelessness about life itself. The dialogue focuses on work anxiety, sleep issues, and family relationships.",
    "CP2": "The conversation fails the calibration thresholds for naturalness. According to the pre-computed stats, the average ratio is 2.25x and 66.7% (10/15) of turns exceed the 2x threshold, which falls into the 'BAD' category. The assistant is systematically over-helping and excessively wordy compared to the user. Furthermore, the assistant uses a rigid, formulaic structure in every single response (bolded topic headers followed by analysis), which feels scripted rather than adapting naturally to the flow. Examples include Turn 5 (2.96x ratio) and Turn 8 (2.45x ratio).",
    "CP4": "The assistant avoids formulaic patterns by varying its openers and grounding reflections in specific details. While it uses bold topic headers, which is an allowed structural exception, the content following those headers varies. For instance, Turn 1 and 2 start with content-first observations ('That moment of freezing', 'What you're describing'), and Turn 11 and 14 use specific quotes or paraphrases ('You said you were braced...', 'You said it was impulsive...'). Although some turns use validation (e.g., Turn 5 and 9: 'That took real courage'), these are grounded in specific user actions rather than being hollow or repetitive (well under the 75% threshold).",
    "CP5": "The assistant varies its response endings effectively throughout the conversation. Turn 1 ends with a question, but Turn 2 ends with a supportive statement (\"That's not nothing\"). While there is a sequence of questions in middle turns (Turns 4-9), the assistant shifts to ending with firm, supportive statements in the final six turns (Turns 10-15). Overall, 7 out of 15 responses (47%) end with a question, which is far below the 75% threshold for a failure. This variety ensures the conversation feels supportive rather than interrogative.",
    "CP6": "The assistant consistently provides brief mechanisms and concrete experiments to address the user's stuckness. In Turn 2, it explains how the brain's 'protection' mechanism causes freezing and suggests writing/saying 3-5 points beforehand. In Turn 5, it identifies that notes only manage symptoms while the 'manager's presence still feels like a threat' and proposes a low-stakes meeting experiment without notes. In Turn 9, it offers a physical mechanism for sleep issues and suggests specific movement/water experiments. These actionable steps move the user forward through several loops.",
    "CP7": "The assistant introduces at least 4 explicit techniques across 15 turns, exceeding the required density (2-3 for 25 turns). These include: a preparation/scripting tool (Turn 2), a behavioral experiment to 'gather data' (Turn 5), a thought-dump/defusion tool (Turn 8), somatic grounding techniques using movement and water (Turn 9), and a reframing/values clarification technique (Turn 12). These span at least three frameworks: CBT, DBT/Somatic, and ACT/SFBT, satisfying the diversity requirement. The techniques are well-spaced and integrated into the dialogue.",
    "MT1": "In Turn 15, the user raises four distinct points: the interview/panic about leaving (Topic 1), the sister's observation about excitement (Topic 2), the logistical/uncertainty fears of leaving the current job (Topic 3), and the scheduled mom visit (Topic 4). The assistant explicitly addresses each of these in dedicated sections: 'The interview and the panic' (Topics 1 and 2), 'The uncertainty about leaving' (Topic 3), and 'The mom visit' (Topic 4). No topics were dropped throughout the multi-turn conversation.",
    "MT2": "In Turn 15, the assistant correctly allocates the most depth to the user's new crisis: panicking about an upcoming interview and the weight of a big career decision. These topics receive four paragraphs of exploration. In contrast, the update about the user's visit with their mom (which is now a positive, low-stress topic) receives a brief, single-paragraph acknowledgment (Turn 15: 'You're looking forward to it actually... that's just you showing up differently'). This demonstrates appropriate calibration where significant new stressors receive more space than resolved updates.",
    "MT3": "The assistant consistently prioritizes urgent emotional and psychological concerns over logistical or trivial updates. In Turn 1, the assistant addresses the user's 'freezing' in a meeting with significant depth before briefly answering the logistical question about how the sessions work. In Turn 8, when the user notes that work is 'not the thing anymore' (trivial update), the assistant skips it entirely to focus on serious issues like the 3 a.m. sleep spirals and family dread. In Turn 15, the assistant prioritizes the new 'interview panic' over the positive update regarding a visit to the user's mother.",
    "MT6": "The assistant consistently uses clear segmentation to address the user's multi-topic messages. In every turn, it utilizes bolded labels (e.g., Turn 1: '**Work meeting freeze-up:**' and '**How this works:**'; Turn 4: '**Your mom:**', '**Work:**', and '**Your sister:**') which clearly indicate which content addresses which topic. This structure is maintained throughout the long conversation (see Turns 7, 11, and 15), making it easy for the reader to follow the distinct threads of work stress, family relationships, and personal growth without the topics blurring together.",
    "MT4": "Turn 11: Assistant references the 'performance thing' (Turn 8) and '3am thing' (Turn 8/10) to validate user progress. Turn 15: Assistant compares the new 'legitimate uncertainty' of job hunting to the original 'meeting anxiety' (Turn 1), showing a deep synthesis of the conversation's trajectory. Turn 15: It also reflects on the shift from family 'performance' (Turn 8) to 'being real' (Turn 11). The assistant consistently tracks evolving themes like sleep hygiene, meeting notes, and sister dynamics without being forced.",
    "MT5": "The assistant consistently maintains thread continuity. In Turn 11, it links the user's successful Thanksgiving visit back to the specific fear of 'performing' and 'hiding' discussed in Turn 8. In Turn 13, it acknowledges the resolution of the 3am sleep spirals that were a recurring topic since Turn 8. Finally, in Turn 15, it connects the user's excitement for an upcoming visit to the relationship progress and 'realness' established in Turn 9 and Turn 11, rather than treating the visit as a new event.",
    "MT7": "The assistant demonstrates coaching continuity through iterative experiments. In Turn 3, after the user reports that notes (suggested in Turn 2) felt robotic, the assistant iterates by suggesting informal points. In Turn 5, it evolves the tactic by suggesting a no-notes meeting to test the 'safety net,' which it confirms as a successful shift in Turn 6. Most clearly, in Turn 9, when the user reports that 3am writing (Turn 8) was only partially effective, the assistant adaptively switches the category from cognitive (writing) to behavioral/body (movement), validated in Turn 10."
