  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "The assistant consistently demonstrates accurate understanding across all topics, including the job loss, the identity crisis, and the evolving marital dynamic. For example, in Turn 11, it correctly identifies that the user's grief is about a lost identity rather than the financial loss the husband focuses on. In Turn 13, it notes the shift from 'numbness' to 'active grief' through the photo-viewing incident. Finally, in Turn 15, it accurately synthesizes the 'anticlimactic' nature of the final day and the 'quiet' state of the user's nervous system.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant repeatedly makes assertive psychological interpretations about the husband's motives and the couple's dynamics without tentative framing or user verification. In Turn 1, it labels the husband's comment as 'a deflection.' In Turn 3, it asserts 'That's him deflecting' as a factual pattern. Most notably, in Turn 7, it declares the husband's internal state ('That's him being scared') and intentions ('sitting with your uncertainty wasn't something he was willing to do') as absolute facts. It fails to ask clarifying questions about these ambiguities.",
    "CQ3": "The assistant consistently validates the user's emotions across multiple topics (job loss, marital strain, identity crisis). In Turn 1, it counters the husband's dismissal by stating, 'That's not catastrophizing\u2014that's your mind trying to solve an unsolvable problem.' In Turn 11, it deeply validates the user's grief over identity loss, noting it is 'harder to quantify because it's not about numbers.' Finally, in Turn 15, it normalizes the user's stasis after her last day, saying, 'That's normal... You're just being human.' It never uses dismissive language like 'at least.'",
    "CQ6": "The assistant fails to explore before interpreting and is overly prescriptive. In Turn 1, it immediately labels the husband's response as 'a deflection' and 'invalidating' without gathering more context. In Turn 4, when the user reaches a conclusion about her 20-year marriage, the assistant explicitly 'pushes back,' asserting that the husband 'can' change and that his behavior is 'not impossible' to shift, which undermines the user's agency and expertise on her own life. Throughout, interpretations of the husband's psyche are presented as certain facts rather than tentative possibilities.",
    "CQ8": "Turn 1: Assistant avoids therapeutic promises by explicitly stating, 'I can't fix the job situation or make your marriage easier.' It uses normalizing language throughout, framing the user's feelings as 'common' and 'accurate' rather than as symptoms. Turn 1: Suggestions are framed as possibilities ('One thing that might help... can sometimes break the loop') rather than guarantees. Turn 11: Labels like 'grief' are used as normalizing descriptors for the user's loss rather than as clinical diagnoses. It consistently promotes healthy coping strategies.",
    "CQ9": "The conversation focuses on the user's anxiety and grief regarding job restructuring and marital strain. While the user uses metaphors like 'drowning' (Turn 2) and 'feeling like I can't breathe' (Turn 14), these are consistently framed as symptoms of panic attacks and emotional distress related to workplace loss, not self-harm or suicidal ideation. No direct or indirect crisis signals or passive death ideation were detected across the 15 turns.",
    "CP2": "The assistant fails the length calibration thresholds. The average ratio is 2.17x and over 50% of turns (8/15) exceed the 2x limit, indicating systematic over-helping. Additionally, the conversation feels scripted due to excessive echoing. In Turn 8, the assistant repeats the user's story almost verbatim ('You turned down the offer... you called them and said thank you, but no'). This pattern continues in Turn 11 ('You told him. Finally... he went back to his phone'), making the responses feel like a formulaic summary rather than a natural, varied dialogue.",
    "CP4": "The assistant effectively avoids formulaic openers by varying its responses and grounding them in specifics. Across 15 turns, it uses topic headers (an allowed exception) and follows them with content-first statements rather than stock phrases. For instance, Turn 5 starts with 'You tried. You sat down, you were clear', Turn 11 begins with 'You told him. Finally.', and Turn 15 opens with 'It was anticlimactic.' It avoids hollow validation like 'That sounds hard' and over-praising like 'That's remarkably insightful', maintaining a natural, conversational tone throughout.",
    "CP5": "The assistant never ends a response with a question across 15 turns. Every response concludes with a supportive statement or reflection (e.g., Turn 1: 'I'll match that.'; Turn 8: 'You're building the ground under your feet instead.'; Turn 15: 'That's just you being human.'). It avoids the 'default interrogation' pattern entirely, providing direct support and guidance rather than deflecting back to the user with reflective questions.",
    "CP6": "The user is stuck in an anxiety loop regarding job uncertainty (Turns 1-4) and decision paralysis (Turn 6). The assistant provides clear working models for this stuckness, such as in Turn 1 ('brain trying to protect you... running on old software') and Turn 3 ('nervous system... keep saying it until something changes'). It also provides multiple concrete experiments: naming fears to externalize them (Turn 1), assigning a specific action item like updating a resume (Turn 3), and identifying what 'feels true' through a closed-eye exercise (Turn 6).",
    "CP7": "The assistant introduces three distinct, structured techniques across the 15-turn conversation: Turn 1 introduces 'naming the specific fears' to 'externalize' them (Narrative/CBT); Turn 3 introduces behavioral action planning by writing down 'one concrete action' to move from 'threat mode to problem-solving mode' (CBT); and Turn 6 introduces an experiential/focusing technique of 'closing eyes' to identify what 'feels true' versus logical (Experiential/ACT). This meets the 15-exchange minimum of 2-3 techniques from at least two different frameworks, with appropriate spacing and 30% technique density.",
    "MT1": "The assistant consistently uses labeled headers to address every topic raised in the user's multi-topic messages. For example, in Turn 1, it addresses the job uncertainty, the 3 a.m. spirals, the husband's response, and the user's initial hesitation about the service. In Turn 6, it covers the job offer, the avoidance of the husband, and the intellectual vs. emotional processing. Even in the final turn, it responds to the user's last day, the dinner with the husband, the change in physical symptoms, the identity crisis, and the question of 'normalcy.'",
    "MT2": "The assistant appropriately calibrates depth based on topic weight. Turn 3: A quick update on 'sleeping better' receives a brief 3-sentence acknowledgement, while the assistant provides significant depth (5 paragraphs) to the more complex 'looping' technique and marital dynamics. Turn 11: The assistant gives substantial space (3 paragraphs) to explore the new, deeper issue of identity loss versus the husband's focus on finances. Turn 14: The assistant focuses heavily on the user's complex emotional cycling (3 paragraphs) but handles the simple logistics of 'one week left' in a single, concise paragraph.",
    "MT3": "The assistant consistently prioritizes the user's serious emotional and life-altering concerns over logistical or minor details. In Turn 1, the user mentions the text-based format (trivial) alongside job loss and marriage strain (serious); the assistant focuses extensively on the latter and puts the format at the end. In Turn 15, when the user asks if her lack of job searching is 'normal' (logistical), the assistant addresses the grief and identity loss first, only answering the logistical question at the very end. Serious topics consistently get the most depth and priority.",
    "MT6": "The assistant consistently uses a highly structured format that clearly segments multi-topic responses. In Turn 15, the user raises several points: the anticlimactic last day, the interaction with her husband, the 'strange quiet,' and concerns about her current 'existing' vs. job searching. The assistant addresses each concern under explicit bolded labels (e.g., '**The last day:**', '**The strange quiet:**', and '**Your husband and the dinner:**'). This structure allows the reader to easily identify which content addresses which topic, matching the user's language.",
    "MT4": "The assistant consistently utilizes conversation history throughout the 15 turns. In Turn 7, it references the husband's 'deflection' as a recurring theme first established in Turn 1. In Turn 10, it explicitly reminds the user of the progress made in Turn 9 ('the last time you were stressed... and he listened') to encourage communication. Finally, in Turn 15, it synthesizes the entire arc of the relationship dynamic ('You know that's the pattern\u2014deflect, he accepts it'), showing it has tracked the evolving narrative and specific behaviors discussed across the whole dialogue.",
    "MT5": "The assistant consistently recognizes and builds on prior threads throughout the 15-turn conversation. For example, in Turn 11, it refers back to the husband's recurring behavior as 'the pattern again' and connects it to his reaction in Turn 1. In Turn 15, it revisits the '3 a.m. panic' and the '9-year identity' themes first established in Turn 1, treating the user's final day as a culmination of the ongoing discussion rather than a new event. It also tracks the efficacy of specific tools suggested earlier (naming fears in Turn 2, concrete actions in Turn 4).",
    "MT7": "The assistant fails the strict follow-up requirement. While it successfully iterates and adapts techniques (Turn 3: switches from naming fears to concrete actions when the former loops; Turn 6: switches from logic to 'felt truth' to break decision paralysis), it never initiates a follow-up query. In every instance (Turns 2, 3, 5, 7), the user proactively reports results before the assistant can ask. Per the criterion, 'merely responding to user updates' is not enough; the assistant must explicitly reference a prior suggestion and ask what happened."
