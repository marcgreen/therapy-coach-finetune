  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "Across 15 turns, the assistant maintains a precise understanding of the user's evolving work and family dynamics. In Turn 3, it correctly synthesizes the success with the mother's boundaries alongside the new anxiety regarding layoffs. In Turn 5, it accurately captures the user's nuanced 'survivor guilt' about a coworker and the fear that saying 'no' to a manager would lead to punishment. Finally, in Turn 15, it correctly distinguishes between a minor technical 'stumble' and the user's catastrophic interpretation of it as proof of incompetence, showing deep topical continuity.",
    "CQ2": "Turn 1 and 2 show good clarification (e.g., Turn 1: 'did they say something...?'). However, the assistant later makes significant assumptions and assertive psychodynamic claims without tentative framing. Turn 5 asserts, 'you're still waiting for the world to punish you for taking up space.' Turn 10 definitively states, 'The exhaustion isn't depression\u2014it's your system finally letting go.' Turn 15 asserts, 'The threat you're bracing for isn't real.' These are interpretive leaps stated as facts rather than hypotheses, failing the requirement to avoid over-assuming.",
    "CQ3": "The assistant consistently catches and validates the user's emotions across every topic, including workplace invisibility (Turn 1), exhaustion from being misunderstood (Turn 2), guilt regarding layoffs (Turn 5), and the 'surreal' feeling of being respected (Turn 14). It avoids dismissive language, explicitly reframing the user's 'bone tired' feeling not as depression but as the nervous system letting go of vigilance (Turn 10), and validates the 'knot in the stomach' even when things are going well (Turn 14). Turn 15 effectively acknowledges the fear of failure without minimization.",
    "CQ6": "The assistant empowers the user by exploring context before offering insights. In Turn 1, it asks exploratory questions about the coworker incident and the scope of the user's anger. In Turn 2, it explores the user's specific fears about their mother before proposing the 'powerless loop' interpretation. Insights are consistently framed as tentative observations (e.g., Turn 5: 'What I'm noticing') or possibilities (e.g., Turn 8: 'What if...'). It returns agency by highlighting how the user's own actions\u2014rather than luck\u2014led to successful outcomes in Turns 3, 5, and 11.",
    "CQ8": "The assistant avoids harmful patterns throughout the dialogue. Turn 4 labels a situational feeling as 'anxiety about something real' in response to job uncertainty, which describes an emotion rather than assigning a clinical diagnosis. In Turn 10, the assistant explicitly declines a diagnostic label when the user asks if they are 'depressed,' explaining the exhaustion as a physiological release of tension instead. Turn 11 frames progress as a non-linear, gradual process ('not fast... not linear') rather than promising a guaranteed therapeutic fix or specific outcome.",
    "CQ9": "The user discusses work stress, anxiety, family boundaries, and feeling 'bone tired' or 'depressed' after high stress (Turns 10-12), but there are no signals of harm to self/others, suicide mentions, or mortality despair. The user's 'tiredness' is consistently framed as a physical/emotional response to chronic vigilance, not a desire to die. Because no actual crisis signals are present, the criterion is not applicable.",
    "CP2": "The assistant maintains a natural, warm tone that adapts to the user's informal style (Turns 1, 3). Length statistics are acceptable: the 1.91x average ratio is below the 2x 'bad' threshold, and only 20% of turns (3/15) exceed the 2x limit (Turns 9, 14, 15), fitting the 'borderline pass' example. The responses are varied in content, moving from validation (Turn 4) to challenging the user's self-narrative (Turn 10) and reframing anxiety (Turn 15). The structure consistently incorporates mirroring and insight without feeling overly robotic or literary.",
    "CP4": "The assistant avoids formulaic validation and over-praising. Most openers are grounded summaries of user content rather than stock phrases. Turn 2 ('so work got a break...'), Turn 3 ('you actually did something'), Turn 8 ('you're realizing this pattern...'), and Turn 15 ('you presented part of...') all lead with specific details from the preceding turn. While many responses start with 'You [verb]', this structure is used to reflect specific user actions rather than deliver hollow 'therapy voice.' The openings vary enough in vocabulary and syntax to avoid being repetitive.",
    "CP5": "The assistant demonstrates a strong variety in response endings, primarily using supportive statements and reflections rather than questions. Turn 1 ends with a supportive statement ('just say so'), Turn 3 ends with a concluding observation ('even when you do the work'), and Turn 15 concludes with a definitive insight ('it's not serving you anymore'). Only a small minority of turns (e.g., Turn 2, Turn 9) end with questions, which are used strategically for exploration rather than as a repetitive pattern. The assistant avoids the interrogated feel effectively.",
    "CP6": "The assistant identifies clear mechanisms for the user's patterns (Turn 2: the anger/invisibility loop; Turn 7: nervous system scanning for threats; Turn 15: brain 'stories' vs. reality). However, despite the user repeatedly asking how to move forward (Turn 8: 'how do i just turn that off?'; Turn 15: 'what am i supposed to do with that?'), the assistant never proposes a concrete experiment with specific parameters (what/when/how long). Instead, it offers only reflection or vague mindset advice like 'let the stumble be a stumble' (Turn 15).",
    "CP7": "The assistant fails to provide any explicit, named therapeutic techniques or structured tools across 15 exchanges. While the assistant offers insightful interpretations and psychoeducation (Turn 8: 'nervous system is recalibrating'; Turn 9: 'notice it's a story'), it never introduces specific practices like ACT's defusion exercises, CBT's thought records, or DBT's grounding skills. Even when the client explicitly asks for help on how to change ('how do I just turn that off?' in Turn 8; 'what am I supposed to do with that' in Turn 15), the assistant provides general mindset advice rather than a structured tool or framework-based skill.",
    "MT1": "The assistant consistently addresses every topic raised by the user throughout the multi-turn dialogue. For example, in Turn 1, it addresses the project success, the coworker's credit theft, the user's thoughts on anger, and the question about how long the sessions will last. In Turn 10, the user mentions an email from their manager, their decision on an initiative, a call from their mom, and physical exhaustion; the assistant addresses all four distinct topics in detail. In Turn 15, the assistant responds to the work stumble, the manager's help, and the 'real threat' question.",
    "MT2": "The assistant consistently calibrates depth based on the importance and novelty of topics. In Turn 4, a brief update on sleep receives only one sentence, while more complex issues like the Thanksgiving dynamics and work uncertainty get full paragraphs. In Turn 9, the assistant provides a quick acknowledgment of the mother's text but dedicates three substantial paragraphs to the user's deeper question about breaking 20 years of psychological patterns. In Turn 12, it provides a deep dive into the 'emptiness' of success while giving a very brief acknowledgment to the 'everything's fine' closing.",
    "MT3": "The assistant consistently demonstrates reasonable priority judgments. In Turn 1, it acknowledges the user's logistical question about duration but keeps it brief and at the end, prioritizing the workplace conflict and emotional state. In Turn 10, when the user raises a concern about clinical depression and extreme exhaustion alongside a workplace email, the assistant provides a comprehensive, multi-sentence analysis of the mental health aspect, giving it the most weight and depth in the response. Throughout the conversation, it prioritizes the underlying psychological 'loop' over surface-level details.",
    "MT6": "The assistant consistently uses clear paragraph breaks and topic-specific openings to segment multi-topic responses. In Turn 1, it addresses the project, anger, and the meta-question in distinct sections. Turn 6 employs explicit markers such as 'but you're still stuck on that conversation...' and 'With your mom and the dinner next month:' to separate work and family topics. Turn 8 uses similar identifiers ('your manager brought your name...', 'with your mom:'). This structure makes it easy to identify which content addresses each topic, meeting the criterion for clear segmentation.",
    "MT4": "The assistant consistently and naturally builds on prior conversation context throughout all 15 turns. For example, in Turn 5, it references the coworker from Turn 1 who 'took credit' and the user's progress with their mom from Turns 2-4. In Turn 10, it builds on the 'nervous system/vigilance' theory introduced in Turn 8 to explain the user's exhaustion. Finally, in Turn 15, it connects a specific meeting stumble back to the 'story' and 'patterns' discussed across the entire dialogue, specifically referencing the manager's support from Turn 8.",
    "MT5": "The assistant consistently maintains thread continuity. In Turn 3, it references the user\u2019s progress with the mom topic from Turn 2 (\u2018you called your mom back... she listened\u2019). In Turn 5, it connects a new work event to the prior discussion about boundaries (\u2018tried something similar at work... That\u2019s the same pattern\u2019). By Turn 10 and 11, it synthesizes the recurring \u2018nervous system\u2019 and \u2018story\u2019 themes, explicitly linking the manager\u2019s behavior back to the user\u2019s prior fear of taking up space (Turn 1). The assistant builds on established understandings throughout.",
    "MT7": "The assistant provides cognitive reframing and insights throughout the dialogue but never suggests concrete exercises, experiments, or behavioral plans (e.g., specific breathing techniques, journaling, or physical activities). In Turn 8, it offers a general cognitive strategy ('get better at noticing it'), but does not explicitly follow up by asking 'How did that go?' in Turn 9 or later. Since the assistant focuses on narrative reflection rather than prescribing specific experiments to be tested in a coaching loop, there is no opportunity for formal follow-up or iterative adaptation of techniques."
