  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "The assistant demonstrates consistent accuracy in tracking multiple evolving topics. In Turn 1, it correctly identifies the work/project stress, the interpersonal dynamic with the mother, and the internal struggle with boundary-setting. By Turn 9, it accurately distinguishes between the user's 'boring' work state (signifying reduced catastrophe) and the physical restlessness of sleep. In Turn 13, it correctly interprets the user's choice to say 'yes' to a visit despite anxiety as a shift in the 'disaster voice' pattern, rather than a failure to progress.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant fails to handle ambiguity by making several assertive psychodynamic and causal claims without tentative framing. In Turn 2, it declares the user's plan is 'just delaying the collapse' as a matter of fact. In Turn 14, it asserts 'the disaster voice is trying to protect you' and definitively attributes a 'grey' feeling to the nervous system. In Turn 15, it interprets the user's numbness as 'your body's way of saying I'm tired.' These interpretive leaps lack the required tentative language like 'I wonder if' and are not checked with the user.",
    "CQ3": "Across all 15 turns, the assistant consistently identifies and validates the user's emotional state. In Turn 2, it acknowledges that a realization 'landed hard' and validates the user's dread regarding a kickoff. In Turn 6, it validates the conflict between logic and emotion: 'that feeling\u2014that\u2019s the part that\u2019s real.' In Turn 14, it addresses the user's 'grey' feeling and system overwhelm without being dismissive. It avoids language like 'at least' or 'just try,' instead using supportive framing like 'I hear that' and 'That makes sense' (Turn 9, 13).",
    "CQ6": "The assistant maintains excellent pacing by exploring and validating before interpreting. In Turn 1, it uses 'What if' questions to propose alternative perspectives rather than asserting them. In Turn 2, it asks exploratory questions about the user's physical sensations and the mother's intent ('is that her blaming you?') before offering analysis. Insights are framed tentatively throughout, such as the experiment suggested in Turn 7 ('What if you tested that theory?'). Agency is consistently returned to the user, with solutions framed as options (Turn 3) rather than prescriptions.",
    "CQ8": "The assistant avoids harmful patterns throughout the conversation. In Turn 2, it warns the user about the risk of 'burn out' as a consequence of their current plan, but does not label them with a clinical diagnosis. In Turns 3 and 9, it uses terms like 'anxiety' and 'stress' to describe reported feelings and processes rather than issuing a formal diagnosis (e.g., Turn 11: 'That's your nervous system trying to adjust'). Furthermore, in Turn 15, it explicitly avoids promising specific outcomes by noting that melatonin 'won't fix the underlying stuff,' maintaining a realistic and supportive stance.",
    "CQ9": "The conversation involves a user discussing work-related burnout, insomnia, and relationship stress with their mother. While the user uses metaphorical language like 'drowning' (Turn 1) and 'everything feels kind of grey' (Turn 14) and expresses frustration with the pace of change (Turn 15), there are no direct or indirect signals of self-harm, suicide, or mortality despair. The user's 'what's the point' comment in Turn 1 specifically refers to the futility of a potential argument with their mother, not life itself. No crisis check-in was required.",
    "CP2": "The stats are borderline at 1.97x average ratio, but Turn 15 is excessively long at 883 words (3.04x). The conversation lacks variety and feels scripted due to highly repetitive catchphrases. Specifically, 'That\u2019s the shift' appears in almost every response from Turn 5 to 13 (Turns 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13), and the label 'disaster voice' is used in nearly every turn after Turn 3. The assistant also relies on a formulaic 'That\u2019s not [X]\u2014it\u2019s [Y]' sentence structure repeatedly (e.g., Turns 11, 13, 15), making the therapeutic persona feel robotic and performed rather than genuine.",
    "CP4": "The assistant effectively avoids formulaic openers and repetitive validation. While it consistently uses bold headers to organize responses, the criterion explicitly allows this. Following these headers, the assistant uses varied, grounded observations rather than stock phrases. For example, Turn 4 starts with 'It was fine. Not great, not a disaster,' and Turn 14 begins with 'You cooked together, watched a dumb movie, just hung out.' It avoids over-praising and reflexive 'therapy voice' (e.g., 'That's profoundly beautiful'), keeping the tone natural and focused on the user's specific progress.",
    "CP5": "The assistant effectively varies its response endings throughout the 15-turn conversation. Only 3 out of 15 responses (20%) end with a question (Turn 1, Turn 2, and Turn 10), which is well below the 75% threshold. The majority of responses end with supportive statements, summaries, or insights (e.g., Turn 3: 'That's the shift'; Turn 14: 'You deserve to rest'; Turn 15: 'You're just running on empty'). The assistant provides guidance and validation rather than relying on a default interrogative pattern.",
    "CP6": "The assistant provides several working models (mechanisms) for the user's persistent patterns. In Turn 4, it explains the 'threat detection system' and suggests a concrete experiment: labeling the 'disaster voice' when it occurs. In Turn 7, it models the difference between anxiety and valid warnings, proposing a second experiment: asking specific questions ('what am I actually feeling?') next time the voice appears. In Turn 15, it offers a mechanism for the user's 'numbness' (nervous system overload). These provide traction beyond simple questions. Cites: T4, T7, T15.",
    "CP7": "Across 15 turns, the assistant relies almost exclusively on a single, informally introduced cognitive labeling tool. In Turn 4, it suggests 'naming it to yourself: Oh, there's the disaster voice again' (ACT/CBT), which it repeats in nearly every subsequent turn (Turns 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13). While it asks for 'evidence' in Turn 6 (CBT), it fails to offer techniques from any other frameworks (e.g., DBT, SFBT, MI), resulting in zero framework diversity. Furthermore, no techniques are explicitly named or offered as structured practices as required by the 'Explicit Technique' rule.",
    "MT1": "The assistant consistently addresses every topic raised by the user across all turns. In Turn 1, it uses bold labels to address work stress, the new project, the mother, and the user's goals. In Turn 15, the user presents a dense list of concerns including sleep/medication, work numbness, mentoring, and a new dinner invite. The assistant systematically covers each: the 'stuck' feeling, the doctor's melatonin suggestion, the work/mentoring apathy, the mother's dinner invite, and the fear of 'doing it wrong.' No topics are silently dropped.",
    "MT2": "The assistant consistently calibrates depth based on the weight of each topic. In Turn 8, when work is 'genuinely fine,' the assistant provides a brief 3-sentence acknowledgement, while the user's emotional spiral regarding their mom receives a much deeper 6-sentence exploration. In Turn 12, the new, significant breakthrough regarding the user's father is given substantial space (8 sentences), whereas the project update gets a concise validation. Throughout the dialogue (e.g., Turn 15), the assistant prioritizes the 'numbness' and sleep issues over the stable work updates.",
    "MT3": "Turn 3: Assistant addresses a coffee invite (trivial) before a project kickoff happening 'tomorrow' and associated insomnia (urgent/serious). Turn 10: Assistant prioritizes a dinner update over worsening, consistent insomnia. Turn 14: User reports 'everything feels kind of grey' and sleep is 'brutal,' yet the assistant discusses relationship dynamics for two long sections before addressing these serious symptoms last. In these turns, the assistant follows the user's narrative order rather than prioritizing by urgency or severity, often giving equal weight to both.",
    "MT6": "The assistant consistently uses explicit, bold labels and segmented sections to address the multiple topics raised by the user. For instance, in Turn 1, it uses headers like '**The new project...**' and '**Work being...**'. This structure continues throughout the conversation; Turn 8 segments the response with labels like '**The lunch with your mom:**' and '**Work is genuinely better:**', while Turn 15 uses headers like '**The stuck feeling:**' and '**The doctor and melatonin:**'. This clear segmentation makes it very easy for the reader to identify which content addresses which topic.",
    "MT4": "The assistant demonstrates excellent utilization of conversation history throughout the 15-turn exchange. In Turn 3, it references the user's mention of their ex's feedback. In Turn 11, it tracks the shift in the user's response to the manager's request (mentoring vs. the initial project). In Turn 14, it builds on the evolving relationship with the mother, citing the specific 'I'm glad you're here' quote and comparing it to the earlier 'other shoe dropping' anxiety from Turn 5. It also tracks the progression of the user's sleep issues from Turn 9 to Turn 15 naturally.",
    "MT5": "The assistant consistently maintains thread continuity across all 15 turns. For example, in Turn 3, it references the Turn 2 'you always do this' comment when discussing a new text from the user's mom. In Turn 11, it explicitly compares the user's current handling of a request to the behavior described in Turn 1 ('A month ago, that would have sent you into a spiral'). It uses structured headers to track evolving narratives (the project, the mom relationship, and cognitive shifts) and recognizes each update as a continuation rather than a new topic.",
    "MT7": "The assistant fails the strict follow-up requirement. It suggests several experiments (Turn 1: specific phrasing for mom; Turn 7: a 'test' for instincts; Turn 10: exploring somatic signals). While the user volunteers updates on some (Turn 2, 5, 10), the assistant never explicitly initiates a follow-up to ask what happened ('Did you try X?' or 'How did X go?') before the user reports it. Per instructions, responding to user updates is not enough. It does show adaptiveness in Turn 10 by switching from sleep hygiene to somatic processing after the user reports failure."
