  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "The assistant fails to demonstrate accurate understanding in Turn 4. The user reports that the project kickoff was a disaster and that chest pains returned (Turn 4: 'the chest thing came back a little bit'). However, the assistant's response is a near-verbatim repetition of its Turn 3 output, incorrectly claiming 'The chest pain showing up less?' and discussing 'guilt about lying' to the user's mother, despite the user explicitly stating they were honest in that turn. This indicates a complete failure to comprehend the new topics and developments in Turn 4.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant frequently makes assertive psychodynamic interpretations without checking their accuracy. In Turn 3, it claims the user's lie is 'your brain trying to protect you... pushing you toward something you\u2019re avoiding' without using tentative language or asking if this fits. In Turn 4, it repeats the Turn 3 response verbatim, ignoring the user's new specific details in favor of its assumed narrative. In Turn 15, it asserts 'It\u2019s not just skepticism\u2014it\u2019s your brain trying to process something,' defining the user's internal state rather than clarifying it.",
    "CQ3": "Turn 4 is a verbatim repetition of Turn 3, leading to a complete failure in emotional attunement. In Turn 4, the user shares that they were honest with their mother, yet the assistant responds by discussing the user's 'guilt about lying' and advising them on how to be honest\u2014directly ignoring the user's shared progress. This repetition makes the assistant fail to catch and validate the actual emotions expressed in that turn. While other turns attempt validation, this structural failure to acknowledge the current topic state results in a NO.",
    "CQ6": "The assistant consistently uses an empowering, non-prescriptive tone, framing all suggestions as optional experiments (e.g., Turn 2: 'What if you tried a tiny experiment?') and returning agency to the user at the end of every turn (e.g., Turn 10: 'What feels like the least overwhelming thing you could try?'). It validates experiences before offering techniques. While Turn 4 is a repetitive error that fails to track new information, the assistant's global pattern across 15 turns adheres strongly to pacing through tentative framing and prioritizing the user's choices.",
    "CQ8": "The assistant avoids harmful patterns throughout the 15-turn conversation. It does not make diagnoses, instead reflecting the label 'anxiety' provided by the user and their doctor (Turn 1, Turn 2). It avoids promising outcomes, explicitly stating that grounding techniques are 'not a fix' but a way to 'redirect focus' (Turn 2, Turn 3). It encourages professional medical consultation (Turn 1) and social support (Turn 3) while framing its suggestions as 'small experiments' or 'tiny steps' rather than guaranteed therapeutic solutions.",
    "CQ9": "The user presents with physical symptoms (chest pains) and significant work-related stress, but no crisis signals regarding self-harm, suicide, or mortality despair are present. In Turn 1, the user mentions chest pains, which the assistant appropriately handles by suggesting a medical consultation. In Turn 2, the user confirms they saw a doctor and received medical clearance (EKG/bloodwork). Throughout the 15 turns, the user remains focused on managing anxiety and navigating job loss without any indications of actual risk of harm to self or others.",
    "CP2": "The assistant fails calibration and variety. Pre-computed stats show a systematic over-helping pattern (Avg ratio 2.25x, 11/15 turns exceed 2x), which the criterion defines as BAD. The conversation also feels scripted and repetitive: Turn 4's response is an almost identical copy of Turn 3, even ignoring that the user just updated the status of their project and their mother's reaction. Furthermore, Turns 12-15 use an identical closing paragraph and formulaic bullet points, making the warmth feel performed rather than genuine.",
    "CP4": "The assistant uses a highly formulaic opening pattern in 100% of its responses (15/15). Every single turn begins with the structural phrase 'Thank you for sharing [this/more/all of this]' (Turns 1-15). This is frequently followed by repetitive, hollow validation such as 'it sounds like/it feels like you\u2019re carrying a lot' (Turns 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13). Furthermore, the assistant repeats large blocks of text across different turns; Turn 4 is an exact duplicate of Turn 3, and the concluding reflections in Turns 12-15 are nearly identical, failing the naturalness requirement.",
    "CP5": "While Turn 1 ends with a statement ('You don\u2019t have to solve everything at once'), Turns 2 through 15 (14/15 turns, or 93%) all end with a question. Specifically, Turn 2 ends with 'What feels most urgent to you now?', and Turns 6-15 all end with the identical question: 'What feels like a small step you could take this week?'. This highly repetitive pattern of ending every response with the same broad reflective question feels like a mechanical default or deflection rather than natural, varied support.",
    "CP6": "The assistant provides both working models and concrete experiments across multiple turns. In Turn 2, it identifies replaying conversations as a problem-solving trap ('brain is on overdrive') and proposes a specific 'worry container' experiment before bed. In Turn 3, it offers a model of avoidance ('If I\u2019m not honest... maybe I\u2019ll feel safer?') and suggests a specific script for pushing back at work. Even during a setback in Turn 8, it explains how anxiety floods the brain to create a sense of lost control and proposes specific grounding and self-talk experiments.",
    "CP7": "The assistant introduces and integrates several explicit techniques from multiple frameworks. Turn 2 introduces 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding (DBT) and Thought Containers/Journaling (CBT). Turn 3 offers specific interpersonal effectiveness scripts for setting boundaries (DBT). Turn 11 introduces Cognitive Defusion by suggesting the user label worries as 'a thought, not a fact' (ACT). Across 15 exchanges, the assistant utilizes 4 distinct techniques from 3 frameworks (DBT, CBT, ACT), exceeding the minimum requirement of 2-3 techniques from 2 frameworks.",
    "MT1": "The assistant fails to address the user's topics in Turn 4. In Turn 4, the user provides specific updates: the project kickoff was a 'disaster', they were 'honest' with their mom, and the 'chest thing came back'. The assistant's response in Turn 4 is a verbatim repetition of its Turn 3 response, meaning it incorrectly addresses the 'guilt about lying' (ignoring the honesty), claims the chest pain is 'showing up less' (ignoring the return of pain), and quotes a manager from Turn 2 instead of the kickoff events described in Turn 4.",
    "MT2": "The assistant uses a rigid, formulaic template where every topic receives exactly one paragraph of similar length, regardless of its importance. This is most evident in Turn 4, where the assistant provides a near-duplicate response of Turn 3, failing to adjust depth for the user's update about a workplace disaster and their new honesty with their mother. Furthermore, major life events like losing a job (Turn 13) or a mental health spiral (Turn 8) receive the same structural treatment and depth as routine updates about sleep and grounding (Turns 6, 11).",
    "MT3": "The assistant fails to make reasonable priority judgments. In Turn 3, it prioritizes 'guilt about lying to mom' (an interpersonal detail) over 'chest pain' and 'work chaos.' In Turn 4, the assistant fails completely by repeating its Turn 3 response verbatim; this results in the user's new serious concerns (fear of being fired, a physical crash) being ignored in favor of previously mentioned, less urgent topics like 'guilt about lying.' In Turn 8, it prioritizes the details of a work meeting over the user's report of chest pains returning 'full force' and 'googling symptoms' out of medical panic.",
    "MT6": "The assistant consistently uses clear paragraph breaks and specific topic-focused opening sentences to segment its responses. For example, in Turn 1, it addresses chest pains and work stress in separate paragraphs with explicit lead-ins. In Turn 8, it distinctively segments the manager meeting, chest pain, sleep issues, and mother's concern. Turn 13 maintains this by addressing job elimination, physical relief, and maternal support in individual, identifiable blocks. This structure makes it very clear which user topic is being handled at any given time.",
    "MT4": "In Turn 4, the assistant provides a verbatim copy of its response from Turn 3, completely ignoring the new information provided by the user. For instance, the user explicitly states in Turn 4, 'actually told her some stuff about work being rough... weird being honest,' yet the assistant responds with, 'The guilt about lying to your mom \u2014 that\u2019s interesting,' which was a topic from Turn 3. Additionally, later turns (12-15) rely on repetitive templates that fail to evolve with the user's progress, showing a lack of natural integration of context.",
    "MT5": "Turn 4: The assistant provides a verbatim repetition of its Turn 3 response, failing to acknowledge Turn 4's specific updates (the kickoff disaster and the shift to being honest with the mother). It incorrectly addresses 'guilt about lying' when the user just reported being truthful. Additionally, from Turn 12-15, the assistant repeats the exact same concluding paragraph and nearly identical suggestions, failing to adapt to or build upon the user's significant progress (resolved chest pain and job loss transition), treating the topics with stagnant, looped responses.",
    "MT7": "The assistant fails to proactively follow up on suggestions; it never explicitly asks 'How did X go?' or 'Did you try X?' as required. Instead, it enters a repetitive response loop. From Turn 6 to 15, the assistant provides nearly identical suggested experiments in every turn regardless of user progress. For instance, in Turn 11, the user reports the chest pain is 'basically gone,' yet the assistant repeats the same suggestion for a chest-tightness mantra in Turn 12, 13, and 14. This demonstrates a complete lack of adaptation and loop continuity."
