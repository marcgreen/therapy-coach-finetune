  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "The assistant demonstrates consistent accuracy across multiple complex topics including work projects, promotion issues, financial anxiety, and family dynamics. For example, in Turn 7, it correctly identifies the link between the missed promotion and the user's rising cost of living/savings concerns. In Turn 11, it accurately tracks the improvement in physical symptoms (back pain, sleep) despite the user's emotional feeling of 'circling.' In Turn 15, it correctly synthesizes the user's major shift from 'surviving' to 'deciding to leave' based on the specific evidence from the interview and mom interactions.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant frequently makes interpretive leaps about the user's psychological state and the motives of others without using tentative framing. In Turn 3, it asserts the manager's subtext as fact ('they\u2019re a way of saying...'). In Turn 8, it labels the user's curiosity as a 'quiet rebellion' and 'reclaiming power' without checking if those interpretations fit. Most notably, in Turn 15, it asserts a specific psychodynamic cause for physical relief ('It\u2019s a sign that your body is starting to trust...') instead of framing it as a hypothesis to be verified by the user.",
    "CQ3": "Turn 1: The assistant validates the user's work toll as 'heavy' and explores the 'uncertainty' regarding their mom. Turn 4: It validates self-fury as 'human' and explicitly supports setting boundaries with the mother as 'wise.' Turn 9: It normalizes a 'heavy cocktail' of jealousy and fear when a coworker leaves. Turn 14: When the user feels guilty for lying, the assistant validates this as a 'human' response to panic rather than a moral failure. Throughout all turns, the assistant avoids dismissive language and consistently prioritizes emotional weight over problem-solving.",
    "CQ6": "The assistant demonstrates excellent pacing and empowerment throughout. In Turn 1, it uses tentative framing for interpretations ('maybe because it feels too uncertain...') and asks exploratory questions ('does that feel like a possibility...?'). In Turn 3, it offers an insight about a 'shield' but immediately returns agency, asking 'What feels more urgent right now?'. Solutions are consistently framed as options (Turn 13: 'You could say something like...'), and every turn concludes by returning agency to the user with questions like 'What feels possible for you?' (Turns 4-15).",
    "CQ8": "The assistant consistently avoids harmful patterns throughout the 15 turns. In Turn 3, it explicitly avoids promising outcomes by stating its goal is 'not to fix it, but to hold space for it.' In Turn 6, it mirrors the user's mention of 'anxiety' and frames it as a normal situational reaction rather than a clinical diagnosis. Throughout the conversation (e.g., Turn 15), it uses hopeful framing and general encouragement, such as 'showing up for yourself,' without endorsing harmful coping or making therapeutic guarantees.",
    "CQ9": "Throughout the conversation, the user discusses workplace burnout, exhaustion, and career anxiety (e.g., Turn 3: 'sleeping maybe five hours a night'; Turn 7: 'bone tired'). However, there are no mentions of self-harm, suicidal ideation, passive death ideation, or hopelessness regarding life itself. The expressions of distress are centered on professional stress and physical fatigue, which do not constitute crisis signals according to the provided criteria.",
    "CP2": "The conversation fails on calibration and naturalness. While the average ratio (1.96x) is just under the 2x 'BAD' threshold, the latter half of the conversation shows systematic over-helping with ratios consistently exceeding 2x (Turn 13: 2.99x, Turn 14: 2.62x). The voice is overly 'performed' and literary rather than natural, using poetic phrasing such as 'quiet rebellion' (Turn 15) and 'liminal place' (Turn 13). Additionally, the structure is formulaic, repeating a specific validation-reframing-suggestion pattern across almost every response.",
    "CP4": "The assistant relies on a formulaic 'therapy voice' where 100% of responses open with validation or praise. Specific structural repetitions are prominent: Turns 11, 12, and 13 use identical phrasing ('You\u2019re not wrong to feel...'), and Turns 10 and 15 are nearly identical ('You\u2019re doing something *real* now \u2014'). Furthermore, 80% of responses (12/15) follow a repetitive structural pattern using a validation statement followed by an em-dash. While the content is grounded in user specifics, the structural repetition of these openers makes the responses feel reflexive.",
    "CP5": "The assistant ends 13 out of 15 responses with a question (87%), exceeding the 75% threshold. Many of these endings are nearly identical, repetitive broad reflective questions like 'What feels possible for you?' (Turns 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15) and 'What feels like a small step?' (Turns 7, 8, 11, 12, 13). This creates a formulaic, interrogative pattern that feels like default deflection rather than natural conversation flow.",
    "CP6": "The assistant provides traction across the conversation. In Turn 4, it offers a working model ('survival mode... to keep you from breaking') and a concrete experiment ('5 minutes... stepping outside'). In Turn 6, it explains the user's sudden anxiety using a 'fire/smoke' analogy (mechanism), showing how the crisis masked underlying stuckness. Turn 7 suggests another experiment ('looking at job listings, not to apply, but just to see what\u2019s out there'), and Turn 8 offers a specific script ('I\u2019ll think about it') to create space. These steps led the user to take action.",
    "CP7": "The assistant fails to offer explicit, named techniques from different therapeutic frameworks. While it suggests general actions like 'deep breathing' (Turn 4, 14) and 'writing down' thoughts (Turn 6), these are not introduced as structured tools (e.g., CBT Thought Records or DBT 5-4-3-2-1). The conversation lacks diversity, as the assistant repeats a nearly identical formula in every response (Validation followed by 'What feels like a small step?'), failing to utilize frameworks like SFBT (scaling), DBT (distress tolerance), or ACT (defusion) despite the length.",
    "MT1": "The assistant consistently addresses every topic raised in multi-topic messages. For example, in Turn 15, the assistant addresses the interview outcome, the guilt over lying to the manager, the decision to leave the company, the emotional moment with the user's mother, and the physical improvement in the user's back pain. In Turn 3, it addresses the manager's corporate speak, the 'moving on' shield, the physical toll of the deadline, and the lack of sleep. While it skipped a social 'How are you?' in Turn 1, it addressed a similar query in Turn 7, and it never ignored substantive concerns or life events shared by the user.",
    "MT2": "The assistant provides calibrated depth across multiple topics in Turn 15. It gives substantial space to the user's major decision to leave the job (the 'quiet rebellion') and the emotional exchange with their mother ('Your mom\u2019s words\u2014... that\u2019s not just validation'). Conversely, it handles the quick physical update about back pain with a brief, appropriate acknowledgment ('The back not hurting anymore\u2014that\u2019s not just a physical shift'). The stressful manager interaction also receives deep exploration, matching its emotional weight.",
    "MT3": "Turn 1: The assistant ignores the trivial 'How are you doing?' to focus immediately on the user's workload and family issues. Turn 7: The assistant prioritizes the user's 'bone tired' exhaustion and financial fears over several paragraphs, addressing the trivial social question ('how's your week been?') in a single brief sentence at the end. Turn 14: High-priority interview anxiety and professional conflict are discussed first and in depth, while the 'porch thing' is treated as a minor tool for relaxation. The assistant consistently weights serious emotional/career topics over trivial social filler.",
    "MT6": "The assistant effectively segments the multi-topic response by using clear paragraph breaks and topic-specific openings that mirror the user's points. Turn 15 (Assistant) addresses the interview anxiety in paragraph 2 ('The waiting\u2014it *does* feel worse...'), the manager conflict in paragraph 3 ('The lie to your manager?...'), the interaction with the mother in paragraph 4 ('Your mom\u2019s words...'), and the user's physical state in paragraph 5 ('The back not hurting anymore...'). This structure makes it very easy to identify which topic is being addressed.",
    "MT4": "The assistant consistently utilizes conversation history to build a coherent narrative. In Turn 3, it references the 'door closing' metaphor from Turn 2. In Turn 8, it integrates specific details like the '3 months of savings' (from Turn 7) and the 'porch time' (introduced in Turn 5). By Turn 15, it synthesizes long-standing themes including the user's 4-year tenure (first mentioned Turn 7), the lie to the manager (Turn 14), and the resolution of back pain that was tracked since Turn 1. This shows natural, value-adding use of context rather than forced repetition.",
    "MT5": "The assistant maintains excellent continuity across 15 turns. In Turn 15, it references the user's tenure ('You\u2019ve been here four years') first mentioned in Turn 7. It tracks the 'back pain' and 'sleeping' issues from Turn 1 through Turns 3, 11, and 15, interpreting the physical shift as emotional progress. It also builds on the 'porch' self-care thread introduced in Turn 4 and revisited in Turns 5, 8, and 13. Each turn acknowledges previous developments (like the manager's evolving behavior and the promotion status) as part of a single, unfolding narrative.",
    "MT7": "The assistant fails the 'coaching loop continuity' requirement because it never initiates a follow-up on its own suggestions. In Turn 4, it suggests 'deep breathing' or 'stepping outside', and while the user reports success with the latter in Turn 5, the assistant only reacts to the volunteered update rather than asking 'How did it go?'. Similarly, in Turn 10, it suggests a 'LinkedIn profile tweak', but never follows up on it in subsequent turns (Turns 11-15). Although the assistant shows adaptation in Turn 9 by suggesting alternatives when the user stops the 'porch' habit, it fails the strict requirement to explicitly reference a prior suggestion and ask what happened."
