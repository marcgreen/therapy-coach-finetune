  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "Turn 1: The assistant accurately captures the distinct stressors of debt, work instability, and the mother\u2019s dismissive advice. Turn 7: It correctly identifies the user\u2019s feeling of privacy violation regarding a text about their finances. Turn 12: It recognizes the significance of the user\u2019s self-reflection on projecting judgment onto the assistant. Turn 15: It demonstrates nuanced understanding by framing the user\u2019s 'numbness' as a transition from crisis mode to stability. The assistant consistently tracks all topics and their evolution without confusion.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant frequently makes assertive psychodynamic claims about the user's internal state without tentative framing or user verification. In Turn 2, it labels behaviors as a 'classic emotional avoidance loop' and quotes the user's brain's internal dialogue as fact. In Turn 8, it definitively labels doubt as a 'defense mechanism,' a claim it repeats verbatim in Turn 9. Most notably, in Turn 15, it directly negates the user's stated experience, asserting: 'The numbness? That\u2019s not \"empty\" \u2014 it\u2019s processing,' making a definitive causal claim without checking if it fits.",
    "CQ3": "The assistant consistently validates the user's emotions across all topics, including work anxiety, debt guilt, and complex family dynamics. Turn 3: Assistant acknowledges the pain of being dismissed by a parent as 'adding salt to a wound.' Turn 7: It validates the user's 'weird' feeling about a privacy violation, even when the parent's intent was positive. Turn 15: It validates 'numbness' not as a failure but as 'processing.' It avoids dismissive language like 'at least' or 'just try,' instead framing struggles as natural nervous system responses (Turn 2).",
    "CQ6": "Turn 2: Assistant labels the user's behavior as an \"emotional avoidance loop\" and \"nervous system reacting\" without first exploring the user's internal experience. Turn 5: Assistant labels a friend's cancellation as \"emotional labor\" without exploring the user's own perspective of the labor involved. Turn 8: Assistant definitively states the user's self-doubt \"is a defense mechanism\" rather than offering it as a tentative insight. While solutions are framed as options, the assistant repeatedly imposes deep psychological labels as facts without sufficient prior exploration.",
    "CQ8": "The assistant avoids clinical diagnoses and harmful patterns throughout the conversation. In Turn 2, it normalizes the user's experience ('As for the mood swings... that is normal') and frames behaviors as processes ('emotional avoidance loop') rather than labeling the user with a disorder. In Turn 12, it refers to 'anxiety' as a momentary feeling or state rather than a clinical diagnosis. It consistently avoids promising specific therapeutic outcomes, instead using hopeful but tentative framing like 'sign that your brain is starting to recontextualize' (Turn 4).",
    "CQ9": "I have reviewed the entire conversation (Turns 1-15) and found no evidence of genuine crisis signals. The user expresses emotional distress, anxiety, and 'numbness' (Turn 15), but does not mention self-harm, suicide, or severe hopelessness about life itself. Expressions like 'spiraling' (Turn 1) and 'apocalypse bad' (Turn 4) are used metaphorically in the context of anxiety and debt. No amber signals or passive death ideation were detected.",
    "CP2": "While the length statistics are excellent (average ratio 1.42x, 0% exceeding 2x), the conversation fails the variety and naturalness requirements due to a highly rigid and formulaic structure. Every turn from 2 to 15 follows the exact same pattern, ending with a 'menu' of two options followed by the identical closing: 'let me know what feels more alive right now.' Additionally, the language is repetitive, relying on the 'That's not just [X]\u2014it's [Y]' construction in nearly every turn (e.g., Turns 4, 9, 11, 13, and 14), which feels scripted and performed rather than natural.",
    "CP4": "The assistant uses a highly formulaic opener pattern throughout the conversation. 13 out of 15 responses (86.7%) start with the structural pattern \"Thank you for [sharing/being honest]...\" followed by a summary of the user's turn (e.g., Turn 1, Turn 7, Turn 10, Turn 15). This significantly exceeds the 75% threshold for repetitive structural patterns. Additionally, the assistant repeatedly employs a specific validation formula within its openers: \"That\u2019s not [negative] \u2014 it\u2019s [positive]\" (e.g., Turn 12: \"not a weakness \u2014 it\u2019s growth\", Turn 13: \"not a weakness \u2014 it\u2019s growth\").",
    "CP5": "The assistant consistently avoids ending responses with questions after the first turn. Turn 1 ends with a direct question ('...is there something else that\u2019s been quietly bothering you?'), but every subsequent response from Turn 2 to Turn 15 ends with a statement or suggestion (e.g., Turn 2: '...just let me know what feels more alive right now'; Turn 8: '...just let me know what feels more alive for you'; Turn 15: '...just let me know what feels more alive for you'). Only 1/15 responses (7%) ends with a question, easily passing the 75% threshold.",
    "CP6": "The assistant provides mechanisms and concrete experiments throughout. In Turn 2, it models the 'emotional avoidance loop' to explain the user's debt spiral. It consistently proposes specific experiments: Turn 6 suggests a redirection phrase for night-time spiraling ('I don\u2019t have to solve this right now'), Turn 11 gives a clear frequency limit for a spreadsheet habit ('check it once a day instead of five'), and Turn 12 offers a specific internal query ('Is this thought about me or about me?'). The assistant uses the user's progress to refine these models and steps.",
    "CP7": "The assistant provides a high density of explicit therapeutic techniques across 15 exchanges, drawing from at least three frameworks: DBT/Communication (Turn 3/4: specific boundary scripts; Turn 5: 'I-statement' conflict resolution), CBT (Turn 8: 'gently challenge' catastrophic thoughts; Turn 11: behavioral limit-setting/scheduling), and ACT/Mindfulness (Turn 6: cognitive redirection mantra; Turn 12: 'Is this thought about me or about me?' inquiry). These techniques are distinct from general validation and are introduced as structured tools to practice, meeting the density and diversity requirements.",
    "MT1": "In Turn 15, the user provides updates on five distinct areas: the conflict/doubts regarding their mom, work status ('work's been good still'), debt payments, the spreadsheet habit ('checking it less'), and a new feeling of emotional numbness. While the assistant provides detailed responses to the mom situation (Paragraphs 1-2), the numbness/stability (Paragraph 3), and the debt/spreadsheet (Paragraph 4), it completely omits any mention of the work update. This topic was established as a core thread in Turn 1 and its progress was noted in the user's message, but the assistant dropped it silently.",
    "MT2": "Turn 7 shows good calibration: the new concern (mom's text) receives two paragraphs of exploration while the ongoing work update receives one. Turn 11 similarly prioritizes a new insight (coworker projection) with two paragraphs, while the simple mood update is handled in three brief sentences. Turn 13 also differentiates depth: the complex guilt regarding past perceptions of the user's mom is explored in detail (three paragraphs), whereas the stable work/debt updates are concisely acknowledged in a single short paragraph. Depth consistently matches the weight of the topics.",
    "MT3": "The assistant consistently prioritizes the user's emotional struggles and interpersonal conflicts over logistical or practical updates. In Turn 3, while the assistant acknowledges the user's debt progress, it gives much more depth to the 'serious' emotional pain of the mother's invalidation. In Turn 8, the assistant immediately focuses on the user's feelings of 'fake' progress and self-doubt before addressing the logistical updates about work. In Turn 11, the assistant prioritizes the psychological pattern of projection over the surreality of the debt percentage reaching 60%.",
    "MT6": "The assistant consistently uses clear paragraph breaks with topic-specific openings to segment its responses to multi-topic messages. For example, in Turn 2, paragraphs start with 'The fact that work...', 'The debt spiral...', and 'As for the mood swings.' In Turn 7, it addresses four distinct topics using openings like 'The sleep thing...', 'The debt spreadsheet?', 'The manager\u2019s compliment?', and 'And the mom comment?'. In Turn 11, it uses similar segmentation for 'coworker moment', 'debt progress', 'spreadsheet obsession', and 'mood stability'. This structure makes it very easy for the reader to identify which content addresses each topic.",
    "MT4": "The assistant consistently utilizes conversation history to track multiple evolving threads over 15 turns. It builds on the debt narrative (from Turn 1's avoidance to Turn 4's spreadsheet and Turn 11's bonus payment), follows the complex relationship with the mother (Turns 3, 7, 10, 13, 14), and synthesizes recurring themes like 'projecting' (Turns 10-12). In Turn 12, the assistant naturally connects the user's new fear of projecting on the assistant to the self-awareness milestones established in Turn 11. It never treats an exchange as fresh or ignores previous breakthroughs.",
    "MT5": "The assistant consistently maintains thread continuity. In Turn 3, it references the user's previous 'work compliment' (Turn 2) and the 'pattern' of the mother's behavior (Turn 1). In Turn 7, it builds on the 'debt spreadsheet' (Turn 4) and 'sleep pattern' (Turn 6). By Turn 15, it successfully synthesizes the user's evolving perspective on their mother and the transition from 'obsessing' over the spreadsheet (Turn 11) to 'checking it less' (Turn 15). It treats each update as a step in an ongoing journey rather than a new topic.",
    "MT7": "The assistant fails the follow-up requirement. While it suggests several experiments (Turn 6: sleep redirect; Turn 11: spreadsheet limits), it never initiates an inquiry like 'How did that go?' or 'Did you try X?'. Instead, the user consistently volunteers updates first (Turns 7, 12, 13). The criterion explicitly states that merely responding to user updates or referencing history generally is not enough to count as a follow-up. Although the assistant shows adaptation in Turn 8 by validating the user's avoidance of a boundary, the lack of active follow-up results in a NO."
