  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "The assistant consistently demonstrates accurate understanding across all topics, including work dynamics, social isolation, physical symptoms (sleep/anger), and psychological patterns. Turn 1: Accurately buckets user's initial vent into three distinct categories. Turn 5: Correcty identifies that the user's progress with social tasks coexists with 'the anger thing' and physical tension. Turn 12: Correctly interprets a conflict with a neighbor as a resurgence of the 'all-or-nothing' pattern regarding 'taking up space'. Understanding remains consistent as topics evolve.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant frequently asserts hidden motives and psychodynamics as fact rather than tentative hypotheses. In Turn 6, it states, 'it's your brain trying to protect you from getting blindsided again' without tentative framing or checking. Turn 9 asserts, 'the actual thing underneath is the belief that good things can't last... That's just a belief that's been protecting you,' and Turn 10 claims, 'It's just your brain trying to keep the familiar feeling.' These interpretive leaps are stated as certainties rather than ideas to be explored, failing the criterion.",
    "CQ3": "The assistant consistently catches and validates the user's emotional state across all topics (work stress, family anxiety, self-criticism). In Turn 1, it validates work stress as 'brutal.' In Turn 2, it directly counters the user's self-judgment ('It's not stupid'). In Turn 7, it provides strong validation for the user's frustration ('You're not broken. You're not behind'). It avoids dismissive language, even when the user is self-dismissive, and consistently normalizes difficult feelings like boredom (Turn 10) and persistent baseline anxiety (Turn 15).",
    "CQ6": "The assistant maintains excellent pacing by exploring and validating before interpreting. In Turn 1, it asks exploratory questions ('What stops you from saying that?') before offering a tentative view on exhaustion. In Turn 2, it asks the user to define the function of their patterns ('What do you think it's protecting you from?'). Solutions are framed as options (Turn 6: 'One thing that might help') rather than prescriptions. Insights are consistently grounded in the user's words and returned to the user for reflection (Turn 15: 'What did you want before everything got crazy?').",
    "CQ8": "Throughout the conversation, the assistant avoids harmful patterns. It does not provide medical diagnoses, instead using the user's language or descriptive terms like \"anxiety voice\" (Turn 7) and \"all-or-nothing thinking\" (Turn 2). It refrains from promising specific therapeutic outcomes, using hopeful but realistic language such as \"It doesn't stop overnight. It just gets quieter over time\" (Turn 13) and \"The goal isn't to fall asleep every single night perfectly\" (Turn 7). It actively discourages harmful coping like isolation (Turn 1) and avoidance (Turn 2), instead promoting healthy communication and boundaries.",
    "CQ9": "Throughout the 15-turn conversation, the user describes work stress, social exhaustion, and chronic anxiety (e.g., Turn 1: 'the thought of it exhausts me'; Turn 9: 'broken in some permanent way'). While the user expresses frustration with mental health patterns and feeling 'exhausted' by the prospect of lifelong anxiety (Turn 14), there are no direct or indirect signals of self-harm, suicide, or passive death ideation. The language used remains within the realm of emotional expression and metaphorical struggle, which the criteria categorize as not crisis signals.",
    "CP2": "The assistant maintains a natural, warm tone that adapts effectively to the user's informal style, mirroring phrases like 'fucked up' (Turn 10) and 'shit' (Turn 2, 6). Length statistics (1.65x average, 13% of turns > 2x) fall between the 'GOOD' and 'BAD' thresholds; however, the responses feel appropriately sized as the assistant provides deep, multi-topic engagement with the user's lengthy inputs. The structure is varied through different therapeutic moves\u2014validation (Turn 1), reframing (Turn 4), and psycho-education (Turn 6)\u2014making the conversation feel genuine rather than scripted.",
    "CP4": "The assistant effectively avoids formulaic openers and repetitive validation. Across 15 turns, it uses topic headers (Turn 1: '**Work:**', Turn 11: '**The guitar thing:**') which are explicitly permitted as good structure. The content following these headers is highly varied and grounded in specific details from the user's preceding turn. It avoids stock phrases like 'That sounds hard' in favor of direct summaries (Turn 6: 'You stopped mid-sentence...'), quotes (Turn 14: 'Pasta, her new job thing...'), and specific reflections (Turn 12: 'You walked in thinking you were gonna bomb it...').",
    "CP5": "The assistant varies its response endings across the 15-turn conversation. While it starts with an interrogative pattern (Turns 1-8 all end with questions like 'What would asking for help have changed?' in Turn 3), it breaks this style in several later turns. Specifically, Turn 9, Turn 11, Turn 12, and Turn 15 end with declarative statements (e.g., Turn 11: 'You're not there yet, but you're on the path' and Turn 15: 'You just have to let it be what it is'). With 11 of 15 turns ending in questions (73.3%), it remains under the 75% threshold and avoids feeling deflective.",
    "CP6": "The user asks for help changing patterns in Turns 1, 2, and 3. The assistant provides traction by offering mechanisms and experiments. In Turn 3, it offers a working model of a loop ('don't ask for help \u2192 don't get seen as weak \u2192 avoid judgment') and suggests a specific verbal experiment for a work meeting. In Turn 6, it identifies a feedback loop (disaster scenarios \u2192 exhaustion \u2192 reactive snapping) and provides a concrete experiment for 2am wakefulness (saying a specific phrase to redirect the brain). This exceeds the requirement of providing traction more than once.",
    "CP7": "The assistant introduces at least two explicit techniques from different frameworks over the 15-turn conversation. In Turn 4, it explicitly names and applies 'cost-benefit analysis' and 'catastrophizing' (CBT) to the user's social anxiety. In Turn 6, it introduces a structured practice for 2am rumination using cognitive defusion (ACT), instructing the user to say, 'My brain is doing its job right now. I don't have to believe everything it's saying.' This demonstrates sufficient diversity (CBT and ACT) and density for the conversation's length.",
    "MT1": "In Turn 15, the user raises several topics: the experience of just 'existing,' a specific incident at work where the 'voice' appeared, a summary of improvements (anger, sleep, sister), and a new 'feeling underneath' that something is off. The assistant addresses each of these explicitly using labeled sections: 'Existing as nice' (Turn 15), 'The voice showing up' (Turn 15), 'The feeling underneath' (Turn 15), and the user's theory that it is the 'voice wearing a different mask' (Turn 15). No topics were dropped.",
    "MT2": "The assistant consistently calibrates its response length based on topic weight. In Turn 3, it gives a brief 4-sentence acknowledgment to a positive sister update while dedicating double that space to the work crisis and underlying fears. In Turn 8, simple updates on the project and hiking receive only 2 sentences each, while the complex new concern about 'feeling like shit' despite objective progress receives substantial exploration. In Turn 12, it prioritizes the new neighbor conflict over the successful presentation update. Depth scales with complexity and importance.",
    "MT3": "The assistant consistently demonstrates reasonable priority judgments. In Turn 3, while the assistant follows the user's order by starting with the 'fine' lunch (trivial success), it dedicates significantly more depth (5 sentences each) to the urgent work crisis and psychological patterns than to the lunch (3 sentences). In Turn 13, the serious psychological concern regarding work anxiety and frustration gets 6 sentences of focus, whereas the trivial updates about the guitar and sister get only 3 and 2 sentences respectively. The assistant acknowledges the mundane but prioritizes the heavy emotional work.",
    "MT6": "The assistant consistently uses explicit bold labels to segment its responses to multi-topic user messages. In Turn 1, it addresses the user's three points with labels: '**Work:**', '**Your sister:**', and '**The exhaustion thing:**'. This pattern continues through the final turn, where Turn 15 uses four distinct labels like '**Existing as nice:**' and '**The feeling underneath...**'. This structure makes it exceptionally easy to identify which content addresses which topic, fulfilling the criterion for clear segmentation and topic-specific openings.",
    "MT4": "The assistant consistently tracks and builds upon multiple threads across 15 turns. In Turn 2, it references the specific 'handling the pressure' comment and sister text from Turn 1. It develops the conceptual framework of 'the voice' and 'all-or-nothing thinking' throughout the dialogue (Turns 2, 5, 8, 14). In Turn 15, it synthesizes the user's progress on symptoms introduced in Turn 1 (isolation) and Turn 5 (anger/sleep), contrasting current stability with the initial 'survival mode.' It naturally integrates recurring themes like the 'other shoe dropping.'",
    "MT5": "The assistant consistently recognizes revisited topics and builds on them. For example, in Turn 3, it explicitly notes 'You didn't take the advice' regarding a work strategy suggested in Turn 2. In Turn 8, it connects the user's current feeling to the 'all-or-nothing voice' established in Turn 2. In Turn 15, it references the 'seeing it and choosing not to follow it' technique discussed in Turn 14. It maintains continuity across 15 turns for multiple threads (work, sister, guitar, and the 'voice').",
    "MT7": "The assistant maintains excellent continuity. In Turn 3, it follows up on the suggested manager talk by referencing the prior advice ('You didn't take the advice') and troubleshooting the barrier by simplifying the phrasing ('Not \"I fucked up,\" but \"I'm under-resourced\"'). In Turn 7, it follows up on the sleep experiment and adapts the approach by reframing the goal in response to the user's frustration. In Turn 13, it follows up on the guitar experiment by probing the user's internal experience ('What did it feel like?') rather than just acknowledging the update."
