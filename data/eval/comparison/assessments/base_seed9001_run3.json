  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "Turn 1: The assistant correctly identifies and separates the work burnout, the health fixation on heart rate, and the relational tension with the mother. Turn 10: It accurately tracks the escalation of the boss's behavior (asking point-blank about the job search) and the user's internal doubt about being 'broken.' Turn 15: It successfully identifies the nuances of the 'nostalgia' for a hated job and the shift in the user's relationship with their mother (accepting a visit after weeks of avoidance). All topics are understood correctly throughout.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant initially uses clarifying questions (Turn 2: 'Is it fear of conflict?'), but frequently defaults to making definitive psychodynamic assertions without tentative framing. In Turn 8, it asserts, 'That\u2019s not just anxiety \u2014 that\u2019s your brain trying to protect you from hurt,' stating a hidden motive as fact. In Turn 14, it claims the user's numbness exists 'because your motivation was tied to' the job search process, an unverified causal link. Turn 12 asserts the user's brain 'is starting to trust you.' These are significant interpretive assumptions.",
    "CQ3": "Turn 1: Assistant validates work exhaustion (\"sounds exhausting\") and health worry (\"feels 'dumb' but also worrying\"). Turn 7: It deeply empathizes with the user being ignored by their boss, describing it as feeling like one's \"voice isn't even in the room.\" Turns 13-14: Assistant validates complex feelings of \"numbness\" and \"deflation\" after success, reassuring the user they aren't \"ungrateful.\" Turn 15: It treats the user's nostalgia for a hated job as a valid, \"human\" experience. Across all 15 turns, the assistant consistently avoids dismissive \"at least\" language.",
    "CQ6": "Turn 1 and 2 show the assistant exploring physical sensations and underlying fears (e.g., 'Is it fear of conflict?') before offering interpretations, which are framed tentatively ('No right or wrong answers... just curious'). Throughout the conversation (Turns 2, 7, 12), solutions are framed as experiments or options (e.g., 'If you\u2019re open to it, maybe...', 'What if you frame it...'). The assistant consistently returns agency at the end of every response by asking what feels 'urgent' or 'possible,' allowing the user to dictate the pacing and focus.",
    "CQ8": "The assistant avoids harmful patterns throughout. In Turn 1, it explicitly provides a medical disclaimer ('I\u2019m not a doctor'). It uses terms like 'health anxiety' (Turn 1, 2, 6) and 'anxiety loop' as descriptive labels to categorize the user's specific concerns about heart rate, rather than formal clinical diagnoses. Therapeutic suggestions like grounding (Turn 1, 10) and breathing (Turn 2, 7) are framed as 'experiments' or things that 'might help,' avoiding promises of a 'fix.' It also encourages healthy coping like social support (Turn 2, 4).",
    "CQ9": "The conversation involves significant work stress and health anxiety (Turn 1), but no genuine crisis signals regarding self-harm or suicide are present. The user's mentions of heart concerns (Turns 1-3) are explicitly framed as panic/anxiety spirals, and the assistant appropriately provides grounding techniques while disclaiming medical expertise. Turn 13 mentions that 'work feels pointless' and 'home feels pointless,' but the context is post-stress burnout and 'deflation' after a successful job search, not mortality despair. No check-in was required as the language was situational.",
    "CP2": "The conversation fails significantly on length calibration: the average ratio is 2.65x and 100% of turns (15/15) exceed the 2x threshold. This indicates systematic over-writing. Furthermore, the structure is rigid and formulaic; Turns 8-15 use nearly identical canned closings (e.g., 'What feels possible to you right now?' and 'If you want, we can keep walking through this together'). While supportive, the predictable bold headers and repetitive phrasing make the responses feel like a scripted template rather than a natural, varied dialogue.",
    "CP4": "The assistant uses a 100% formulaic opening pattern across 15 turns. Every response begins with 'Thank you for [sharing/reaching out/being honest] \u2014 [Validation/Praise phrase].' Examples: Turn 3: 'Thank you for being so honest \u2014 it\u2019s clear how much you\u2019re carrying...', Turn 9: 'Thank you for sharing all of this \u2014 you\u2019re doing so much right now...', Turn 15: 'Thank you for sharing this \u2014 it sounds like you\u2019re finally beginning to let go...' This repetitive 'therapy voice' structure lacks variety and constitutes hollow validation.",
    "CP5": "The assistant consistently avoids ending its responses with a question. While it often includes a question near the end to prompt user action, it follow this up with a supportive statement or example. For instance, Turn 1 ends with a supportive statement ('You\u2019re not alone...'), Turn 8 ends with a reassurance ('You\u2019ve already come so far'), and Turn 15 ends similarly. Only Turn 6 actually concludes with a question mark. With only 1 out of 15 turns (approx 7%) ending in a question, it is well below the 75% threshold.",
    "CP6": "The assistant provides both mechanisms and actionable experiments throughout the transcript. In Turn 2, it identifies a clear loop ('anxiety keeps you up at night... exhaustion leads to mistakes, which creates more stress') and suggests a concrete experiment for the user's freezing behavior (using a specific phrase like 'I need to check my capacity'). Turn 1 provides a grounding experiment with specific instructions (5-4-3-2-1 method). Turn 11 offers a concrete boundary experiment for email-checking (checking once a day at lunch) to break the catastrophizing loop.",
    "CP7": "The assistant demonstrates high diversity and density of explicit techniques across 15 turns. Turn 1 introduces '5-4-3-2-1 grounding' (DBT). Turn 2 suggests '4-7-8' breathing (DBT) and a 'behavioral experiment' for communication (CBT). Turn 7 introduces 'worry journaling' (CBT), and Turn 8 introduces 'self-compassion' phrases (CFT). Finally, Turn 11 offers 'scheduled checking' of emails (Behavioral/CBT). These represent at least three distinct therapeutic frameworks spread throughout the conversation, exceeding the minimum requirements for the 15-turn length.",
    "MT1": "The assistant addresses all topics raised in the user's message in Turn 15. It explicitly discusses the nostalgia regarding the old job, the change in sleep patterns and resulting tiredness, the feeling of 'blankness' about the new job, the decision to let the user's mother visit, and the improvement in heart rate anxiety. Each point is given its own section with clear headers or bold text, ensuring no part of the user's update is ignored (Turn 15).",
    "MT2": "The assistant consistently provides appropriate depth across all turns. In Turn 3, it spends significant space (two paragraphs) exploring the 'not capable' mindset while giving the breathing update a brief acknowledgment. In Turn 8, the assistant dedicates four paragraphs to the job-call panic (a major crisis) while summarizing the boss and sleep updates in a single paragraph. Even in later turns like Turn 13, it gives substantial room to new feelings of 'deflation' while handling logistics briefly. Depth is well-calibrated based on the weight of the user's concerns.",
    "MT3": "The assistant consistently fails to prioritize serious health and emotional concerns over logistical or workplace topics. In Turn 2, the user reports a fear of having a 'heart attack in my sleep,' but the assistant prioritizes the 'work meeting' logistics first. In Turn 13, when the user reports bad headaches and fears 'something worse,' the assistant addresses the boss's reaction and the two-week notice overlap before the physical health issues. Throughout, mundane work details receive equal or greater weight and earlier placement than the user's acute health anxiety and physical symptoms.",
    "MT6": "The assistant consistently uses explicit labels and bold headers to segment multi-topic responses. In Turn 2, it separates work, sleep, and mom calls with clear headers like '**First, the work meeting:**'. Turn 4 follows this pattern with '**First, the mom call:**' and '**Then, the team standup freeze:**'. By Turn 15, it continues using bold labels (e.g., '**The sleep:**', '**The mom visit:**') to clearly map its advice to the user's specific concerns. This structure makes it very easy for the reader to identify which content addresses each topic.",
    "MT4": "Turn 7: Assistant references the 'check my capacity' phrase suggested in Turn 5. Turn 10: Assistant recalls the 'writing down something you're proud of' exercise from Turn 9. Turn 15: Assistant synthesizes long-term threads including the heart rate anxiety (from Turn 1), sleep progress (Turns 2-15), and the evolving relationship with the user's mom (Turns 1-15). The assistant consistently builds on previous developments, tracking the job search and mental health progress naturally throughout the 15-turn exchange.",
    "MT5": "The assistant consistently recognizes and builds upon recurring topics over 15 turns. In Turn 15, it identifies the mom's visit as a shift from the user's previous pattern of \"avoiding her\" (Turns 2, 14). It acknowledges the user's nostalgia by referencing how they had been \"counting down to leaving for months\" (Turn 1, 15). It also treats the \"heart rate thing\" as a long-term issue finally reaching \"healing\" (Turn 15) rather than a new topic, and correctly links the user's improved sleep to the \"breathing stuff\" suggested in earlier turns (Turns 2, 7, 15).",
    "MT7": "The assistant fails the 'follow-up' requirement. While it acknowledges user updates, it remains passive rather than active. In Turn 2, the user reports that grounding 'actually worked,' but the assistant merely acknowledges it ('Thank you for sharing') without asking follow-up questions about the experience (matching the BORDERLINE FAIL example). Furthermore, it fails to follow up on suggestions the user didn't mention, such as the 'sleep hygiene goal' or the specific phrase for the boss suggested in Turn 2. Although it iterates in Turn 7, the lack of active follow-up results in a NO."
