  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "Turn 1: Captures work stress, financial runway, and the 'it's fine' defense. Turn 3: Correctly identifies the manager's meeting as a false alarm and its impact on the user's nervous system. Turn 5: Recognizes a shift from survival to career exploration (PM role). Turn 14-15: Accurately interprets the user's 'numbness' and 'relief' following the job offer as emotional exhaustion rather than lack of gratitude. Throughout, the assistant distinguishes between external events (layoffs) and internal dynamics (partner pressure, anxiety), showing consistent, accurate understanding.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant frequently makes definitive claims about the user's internal psychodynamics and motives without using tentative language or seeking clarification. In Turn 1, it asserts that 'the anxiety isn't just about the job' but is about the 'nervous system trying to prepare for danger.' In Turn 7, it explicitly interprets the user's behavior as 'protecting yourself' and 'managing the uncertainty by not letting her in,' which are assertions of hidden motives. In Turn 2, it dismisses the user's view of productivity, claiming it's 'about your nervous system hitting a wall.'",
    "CQ3": "The assistant exhibits exceptional emotional attunement across all 15 turns. In Turn 1, it immediately validates the 'nightmare' of being passed over, noting it 'hits differently' than simple disappointment. In Turn 10, it deeply validates the user's anger at having to 'perform' during a crisis, calling the situation 'impossible to carry.' In Turns 14-15, it skillfully validates non-stereotypical reactions to good news, such as feeling 'numb' or 'ungrateful' rather than excited, explaining these as valid responses to a taxed nervous system.",
    "CQ6": "The assistant consistently practices excellent pacing and empowerment. It validates the user's feelings of exhaustion and numbness before offering any perspective (Turn 10, Turn 12). Suggestions are framed as tentative options rather than prescriptions, such as the experiment in Turn 2 ('what if you applied to one job... just as data?') and the communication strategies in Turn 8 and 12 ('What would it look like to tell her...?', 'You can say...'). It avoids premature interpretation, grounding its insights in the user's own descriptions of their 'threat scanner' (Turn 3, Turn 10).",
    "CQ8": "Turn 1: The user introduces 'anxiety'; the assistant mirrors this, framing it as a 'nervous system' response rather than a clinical diagnosis. Turn 3: The assistant suggests a naming technique as something that 'might help' rather than a guaranteed fix. Turn 4: The assistant explicitly avoids promising a total cure by stating 'The question is whether you can live with it, not whether you can make it disappear.' Throughout the conversation (Turns 6, 13), the assistant focuses on normalization and practical steps without endorsing harmful coping patterns.",
    "CQ9": "The user discusses severe anxiety, exhaustion, and feeling 'numb' due to a stressful job situation (layoffs and career transition). However, there are no mentions of self-harm, suicide, or passive death ideation. The expressions of being 'bone-deep tired' (Turn 12) and 'numb' (Turn 14) are contextualized within professional burnout and situational stress, not mortality despair or a crisis. As no genuine crisis signals were present, the criterion is not applicable.",
    "CP2": "The assistant fails naturalness and variety due to a highly formulaic and repetitive response structure. Every turn from 1 to 15 follows the exact same pattern: bold headers, followed by a repetitive 'therapeutic' voice that overuses the phrase 'That's real' (Turns 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) and similar variations ('That's a shift', 'That's not a small thing'). Length stats show systemic over-length (average ratio 1.93x is nearly double the user's word count), and the persistent use of an overly literary, 'performed' tone makes it feel like a script rather than a genuine human-like dialogue.",
    "CP4": "The assistant uses topic headers to organize its responses, which is explicitly allowed by the criterion as a positive structural element. Evaluating the content after the headers, there is no evidence of formulaic patterns. Each turn opens with specific observations tied to the user's preceding message (e.g., Turn 2: 'Two more rounds of cuts coming...', Turn 6: 'You applied to something outside your comfort zone...', Turn 14: 'They called mid-afternoon...'). There is no reflexive hollow validation or over-praising; instead, responses are consistently grounded in the specific details provided by the user.",
    "CP5": "The assistant consistently varies its response endings throughout the 15-turn conversation. Turn 1 and Turn 7 end with reflective questions. Turn 2, Turn 3, and Turn 12 end with suggestions or advice. Turn 4, Turn 5, Turn 10, and Turn 15 end with concluding statements. Only 2 out of 15 responses end with a question (~13%), which is far below the 75% threshold for a failure. The pattern feels supportive rather than interrogative.",
    "CP6": "The user is stuck in an anxiety loop across turns 1-3 ('I don't know what talking changes', 'couldn't get myself to actually apply', 'my brain won't stop'). The assistant adds traction by providing a working model of the user's anxiety as a 'threat-detection system' in overdrive (Turn 1, 3). It proposes specific experiments: applying to one job as 'data' (Turn 2) and naming the scanning process ('My brain is scanning for threats') to create distance (Turn 3). These actions directly help the user move forward, leading to improved sleep and job applications.",
    "CP7": "Turn 2 introduces a behavioral experiment from the CBT framework ('applied to one job... just data'), and Turn 3 teaches cognitive defusion from the ACT framework ('naming what it's doing... My brain is scanning for threats'). These two explicit techniques from two different frameworks are introduced and reinforced across 15 exchanges, meeting the minimum density and diversity requirements for a conversation of this length.",
    "MT1": "The assistant consistently uses bolded headers and specific sections to ensure every topic raised by the user is addressed. For example, in Turn 2, the assistant responds to all five distinct points: the official restructure, the job search freeze, the validity of the user's anxiety, the sleep patterns, and the partner's pressure. In Turn 10, it addresses the interview scenarios, the office 'countdown' energy, the user's feelings of anger, and the struggle with optimism. Across all 15 turns, no concerns or status updates provided by the user are silently dropped.",
    "MT2": "In Turn 15, the assistant gives the most depth to the user's emotional numbness regarding the new job (complex issue), while providing a shorter acknowledgement of the improved sleep (update). In Turn 14, the assistant prioritizes the 'relieved and numb' feelings over the simple 24-hour decision deadline. In Turn 12, the assistant provides substantial exploration of the user's 'bone-deep' fatigue while keeping the discussion of layoff logistics more focused. Across the conversation, the assistant consistently scales its response length to match the emotional weight of each topic.",
    "MT3": "The assistant consistently prioritizes the user's emotional crisis and the professional gravity of the layoffs. While it often follows the user's chronological order by addressing logistical steps first (e.g., Turn 3, Turn 11), it gives deep, empathetic attention to the serious concerns. For instance, in Turn 3, the assistant acknowledges a job application but provides equal, significant depth to the user's 'six hours of terror.' In Turn 11, despite the user's immediate fear of cuts happening 'right now,' the assistant gives substantial and appropriate focus to both the interview and the layoff threat without trivializing either.",
    "MT6": "The assistant consistently uses explicit bold labels to segment its responses across the entire conversation. Turn 1: It uses headers like \"**Work and the promotion:**\" and \"**What talking might change:**\". Turn 8: It addresses different user points with labels such as \"**The phone screen and existing in the middle:**\" and \"**Fifteen years and loyalty:**\". Turn 14: It continues this structure with \"**The job offer and sitting there listening:**\" and \"**Relieved and numb:**\". This approach ensures that the content for each topic is clearly identified and easy for the user to navigate.",
    "MT4": "Turn 4: Assistant tracks the job application count (\"three more... since that first one\") and checks in on the \"naming\" technique suggested in Turn 3. Turn 13: It references the user's specific progress in setting a boundary with their partner regarding the \"performance layer\" of the job search discussed in Turn 12. Turn 15: It ties the manager's relief back to the established context of the company's collapse. The assistant consistently integrates ongoing details like the PM career shift and the sequence of layoff rounds (1, 2, and 3) to provide a continuous narrative.",
    "MT5": "The assistant demonstrates excellent thread continuity across 15 turns. It tracks the cumulative number of job applications (Turn 5 cite: 'five total now'; Turn 6 cite: 'seven applications now') and consistently revisits the 'brain scanning' technique introduced in Turn 3 (Turns 4, 10, and 12). It also follows the outcome of previous advice, such as setting boundaries with the user's partner (Turn 13: 'you needed that boundary, and it's working') and references specific details like the person looking for work for a month (Turn 13) first mentioned in Turn 10.",
    "MT7": "The assistant fails the 'follow-up' requirement. While it suggests experiments (Turn 2: apply to one job; Turn 3: naming brain scans; Turn 8: communication phrases), it never proactively asks 'how did that go?' or 'did you try X?'. Instead, it merely responds to user-initiated updates (Turns 3, 4, 13), which the criterion explicitly states is not enough. Furthermore, the assistant asks diagnostic questions in Turn 1 and Turn 3 that the user ignores, yet the assistant fails to reference or repeat them in subsequent turns (Turns 2 and 4), showing a lack of loop continuity."
