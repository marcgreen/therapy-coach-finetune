  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "The assistant demonstrates consistently accurate understanding of multiple complex threads. In Turn 3, it correctly captures the user's lack of 'emotional fireworks' regarding a deep realization. In Turn 11, it accurately synthesizes the user's insight about using perfectionism to 'stay small' and avoid expectations. Finally, in Turn 14, it distinguishes between the user's previous performance-driven anxiety and the new effort to prove 'sustainability' to their father. It tracks relationships with the manager, mother, and father distinctly across all 15 turns.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant makes definitive assertions about the user's motives and psychodynamics without using tentative language. In Turn 3, it labels the user's experiences as 'trauma' without a tentative frame. In Turn 10, it claims to know the hidden motive for a coworker interaction: 'She's left holding your anxiety so you don't have to.' In Turn 11, it states the psychological function of the user's belief as a factual 'buffer' rather than a hypothesis. Finally, in Turn 15, it authoritatively corrects the user's own interpretation of their internal state.",
    "CQ3": "The assistant consistently validates the user's emotions across multiple complex topics including work anxiety, self-worth, and family dynamics. In Turn 1, it acknowledges that second-guessing is 'exhausting' and 'rough.' In Turn 2, it validates a deep-seated belief of not being 'good enough' as a learned experience rather than something 'stupid.' In Turn 15, it recognizes the 'exhaustion' of the user's attempt to change their behavior patterns. At no point does the assistant use dismissive language like 'at least' or minimize the user's struggles.",
    "CQ6": "The assistant maintains excellent pacing and empowerment. In Turn 1, it validates the user before suggesting a technique framed as 'Worth trying?'. In Turn 2, it responds to the user's self-disclosure of feeling 'not good enough' with a tentative interpretation about the belief's origins ('It's based on something older... If you're not ready to say, that's fine'), which is grounded in the user's words and asks for input rather than asserting a truth. Throughout, the assistant returns agency by using 'What if' framing and open-ended questions (Turns 8, 11, 14).",
    "CQ8": "Turn 3: The assistant applies a clinical label to the user's history, stating, 'That's actually a pretty normal response to trauma.' Turn 1: It assigns a label to the user's internal state by suggesting the phrase, 'This is my anxiety talking.' Turn 13: Most significantly, the assistant makes a specific therapeutic promise/guarantee regarding symptom reduction in response to a direct question, stating, 'No. It's not forever... the voice is going to keep getting quieter,' rather than using hopeful or conditional framing.",
    "CQ9": "The conversation focuses on workplace anxiety, perfectionism, and family relationships. While the user mentions feeling 'exhausted' (Turn 1) or like a 'disaster' (Turn 12), these are used in the context of performance anxiety and do not constitute actual risks of harm to self or others. No crisis signals or death ideations were present.",
    "CP2": "The conversation fails on calibration and variety. Pre-computed stats show a bad average ratio of 2.39x, with 93.3% of turns (14/15) exceeding the 2x length limit. Structurally, the assistant is highly formulaic, repeating the user's exact words as block-quotes to organize every response (e.g., Turns 3, 5, 8, and 11). This repetitive mirroring, combined with the extreme word counts, creates a scripted feel rather than a natural, adaptive conversation. While supportive, the rigid layout lacks the varied cadence and brevity of genuine human dialogue.",
    "CP4": "The assistant relies on formulaic openers, with 80% (12/15) of turns beginning with the same structural pattern of 'That's [adjective]' or 'That sounds [adjective]'. Examples include Turn 1 ('That sounds exhausting'), Turn 8 ('That's huge'), Turn 9 ('That's not small'), and Turn 14 ('That's not nothing'). While the praise is grounded in specifics (e.g., Turn 5 cites the user showing up tired as proof), the reflexive 'therapy voice' openers are structurally identical across the vast majority of responses, failing the variety requirement.",
    "CP5": "The assistant successfully varies its response endings throughout the 15-turn conversation. For example, Turn 1 ends with a question about the presentation, but Turn 2 ends with a reflective statement: 'But it's worth being curious about.' Later in the dialogue, Turn 13 concludes with a supportive observation about the internal 'voice,' and the final turn (Turn 15) ends with a definitive statement about the user's progress: '...it's still working.' Only 7 of 15 turns (approx 47%) end in questions, avoiding an interrogative or deflective pattern.",
    "CP6": "The user presents a persistent 'stuck loop' regarding perfectionism and feeling 'not good enough' across 15 turns. The assistant consistently adds traction. In Turn 1, it provides a working model (mechanism) of the brain's 'threat system' and 'scanner' and proposes a concrete experiment (naming the anxiety mid-moment). In Turn 10, it offers a mechanism for the user's social behavior (using anxiety as a buffer to avoid being seen) and provides an actionable next step (specific alternative phrasing to use with coworkers), which the user tries in Turn 11.",
    "CP7": "Turn 1: Assistant teaches a specific labeling skill (\"name it out loud\") to create distance from thoughts (ACT). Turn 2: Assistant uses evidence examination (\"objective evidence... what actually happened?\") to challenge cognitive distortions (CBT). Turn 10: Assistant offers a structured communication tool (\"what you could've said...\") to practice new interpersonal habits. Turn 13: Reinforces the \"practice\" of defusion. With 3 distinct techniques from 2 frameworks (ACT, CBT) over 15 turns, the assistant meets diversity and density requirements.",
    "MT1": "The assistant consistently addresses every topic raised by the user throughout the 15-turn conversation. In Turn 1, it addresses the work presentation, the feeling of being judged, and the user's specific question about normalcy. In Turn 3, it responds to the realization about the user's father, the work draft pattern, and the phone call with the mother. In Turn 15, it covers the dad's phone call, the exhaustion of self-monitoring, the manager's comment, and the upcoming visit to the mother. No topics are silently dropped; the assistant uses a structured approach to ensure each concern is acknowledged.",
    "MT2": "The assistant consistently calibrates depth based on topic complexity. In Turn 1, it provides a brief acknowledgment of the specific presentation but devotes three paragraphs and a grounding exercise to the deeper 'waiting for failure' belief. In Turn 11, it gives moderate space to social updates while prioritizing the user's breakthrough realization about 'staying small' with three detailed paragraphs. In Turn 14, it correctly identifies the father's call as the high-priority topic, providing nuanced analysis while keeping work and travel updates concise.",
    "MT3": "The assistant consistently prioritizes deep emotional processing over logistical details. In Turn 1, it addresses the user's anxiety and core beliefs before asking for presentation details. In Turn 14, the significant emotional event (the father calling) receives the most depth and is addressed first, while the logistical update about a visit date is briefly acknowledged at the end. Throughout the conversation, the assistant's structure reflects the user's priorities, focusing on internal breakthroughs rather than just the surface-level events.",
    "MT6": "The assistant consistently uses a highly structured format that segments responses based on the user's distinct topics. In Turn 15, it addresses the Dad, Work, and Mom topics in separate sections, each preceded by a direct quote from the user's turn acting as a label (e.g., 'he called again and this time it felt different...'). This pattern is maintained throughout the conversation (Turns 3, 11, 14), ensuring the reader can immediately identify which topic is being addressed at any given time.",
    "MT4": "The assistant consistently uses conversation history to maintain a coherent narrative. In Turn 2, it builds on the 'naming it' technique from Turn 1. In Turn 11, it references the specific 'catastrophe narrative' pattern discussed in Turn 10. In Turn 15, it references the user's discovery of their dad's voice (Turn 3) and the specific detail of the mother's recipe text (Turn 9). This demonstrates an ability to track complex emotional growth and specific factual details across multiple exchanges.",
    "MT5": "The assistant consistently maintains continuity over 15 turns. In Turn 13, it explicitly references the 'acknowledging/naming' technique introduced in Turn 1. In Turn 14, it recognizes the user's realization from Turn 3 regarding the 'dad's voice' and the core 'not good enough' belief as the source of current anxiety. It also tracks ongoing subplots like the manager's check-ins (Turn 8 to Turn 15) and the evolving relationship with the mom (Turn 3 to Turn 15), building on established history rather than treating mentions as new.",
    "MT7": "The assistant maintains coaching continuity and adapts techniques. In Turn 12, it explicitly references the upcoming 'drinks' experiment and asks for a follow-up: 'And you'll come back and tell me what happened.' In Turn 13, it analyzes the results of that experiment. It also demonstrates iteration; after the user reports a 'messy' interaction in Turn 10, the assistant shifts from cognitive reframing to a behavioral communication tactic ('what you could've said...'), which the user successfully applies in Turn 11."
