  "reasonings": {
    "CQ1": "The assistant demonstrates accurate understanding of multiple complex threads. In Turn 1, it captures both work perfectionism and social avoidance. By Turn 3, it correctly identifies the 'empty' vs anxious nuance at dinner. In Turn 11, it accurately tracks the workshop success followed by the 'adrenaline crash' and the user's fear that one win won't erase childhood patterns. Finally, in Turn 15, it correctly identifies that the user lied to their mother specifically to avoid pressure to reconcile with their father.",
    "CQ2": "The assistant frequently makes definitive psychological assertions and mind-reads without using tentative language or checking with the user. In Turn 1, it asserts the user's standards are 'about proving something to yourself.' In Turn 3, it claims the user is 'stuck on not being responsible for the outcome.' In Turn 5, it definitively states the reason for avoidance is that 'being seen feels dangerous.' Finally, in Turn 15, it tells the user how they and their mother are 'seeing' the situation. These causal claims about internal motives are presented as facts, not hypotheses.",
    "CQ3": "The assistant consistently validates the user's emotional state across all turns. In Turn 1, it acknowledges that perfectionism is 'exhausting' and the freeze is 'hard.' In Turn 4, it directly counters the user's self-judgment ('That's not stupid') when they feel out of place socially. In Turn 11, it validates the user's post-success 'crash' and numbness as 'not weakness' but a natural nervous system response. Finally, in Turn 15, it affirms the user's 'dark' feelings about their father as 'not dark' but 'honest.' It never uses dismissive language like 'at least.'",
    "CQ6": "The assistant consistently follows the user's pace and provides empowerment through agency. In Turn 1, it explores the user's experience with questions ('What does \"perfect\" look like to you?') before offering the tentative interpretation of perfectionism as 'armor.' It earns the right to deeper psychological connections by waiting for the user to discover them in therapy (Turn 8) rather than imposing them prematurely. Agency is returned frequently, such as in Turn 10 ('What would help you get through tonight?') and Turn 15, where it frames boundary-setting as a choice and asks for the user's perspective on the outcome.",
    "CQ8": "The assistant avoids harmful patterns by consistently framing the user's experiences as normal responses to stress rather than clinical conditions. For example, in Turn 6, it explicitly states 'you're not broken. You're overwhelmed' and 'Therapy isn't about fixing a broken person,' avoiding labels or diagnoses. It encourages the user's ongoing therapy and social connection, specifically warning against isolation (Turn 5, Turn 11). Outcomes are framed as possibilities or gradual shifts (e.g., Turn 12: 'the fear might be different') rather than guaranteed therapeutic fixes.",
    "CQ9": "The conversation involves high anxiety, perfectionism, social avoidance, and interpersonal conflict, but does not contain direct or indirect crisis signals. The user mentions feeling 'numb' (Turn 11) and that things are 'on a knife's edge' (Turn 10), but these are expressed as emotional stress/precariousness regarding a work workshop and social anxiety, not as a risk of self-harm or mortality despair. The user is also actively seeing a therapist (Turn 7, 15), and the assistant provides supportive, non-minimizing feedback throughout.",
    "CP2": "The conversation fails on calibration and variety. Per stats, the average length ratio is 2.20x (exceeding the 2x 'BAD' threshold) and 66.6% of turns exceed 2x length (exceeding the 50% threshold). This indicates systematic over-helping. Additionally, Turn 1 contains a robotic error where the assistant repeats the user's last paragraph word-for-word. While headers are allowed, the structure is rigid and formulaic across all 15 turns\u2014always reflecting on 2-3 specific points with headers and ending with a similar question\u2014lacking the variety expected in natural dialogue.",
    "CP4": "The assistant effectively avoids formulaic openers. Following topic headers, it consistently begins sections by grounding its responses in specific user details rather than using stock validation phrases. For example, in Turn 2, it opens sections with: 'Your brain's still running that loop,' 'You stopped after twenty minutes,' and 'You said no to your own mom.' Similarly, in Turn 14, it starts with: 'You said no when you heard from your dad' and 'Next week. You're trying not to spiral.' There is no evidence of hollow validation or over-praising patterns.",
    "CP5": "The assistant ends 13 out of 15 responses (86.6%) with a question, exceeding the 75% threshold. While the analysis provided is supportive, the consistent use of broad reflective questions at the end of almost every turn\u2014specifically Turn 4 ('What do you think you need...'), Turn 10 ('What would help you...'), and Turn 15 ('What would help you get through tomorrow?')\u2014establishes a repetitive 'default interrogation' pattern. This formulaic approach, occurring even after long speeches, feels like AI deflection rather than a natural, varied conversation flow.",
    "CP6": "The assistant provides traction by moving beyond questions to offer mechanisms and actionable experiments. Turn 1 establishes a working model (mechanism) of perfectionism as 'armor' providing short-term relief but long-term isolation. Turn 6 proposes a concrete experiment: practicing the delivery once to test the fear of freezing. Turn 11 explains the user's exhaustion as a 'nervous system crash' and suggests a specific 'honesty text' experiment to manage social energy. This pattern of grounded insight followed by small behavioral tests occurs throughout the conversation.",
    "CP7": "The assistant fails to provide explicit, named therapeutic techniques from diverse frameworks across the 15-turn conversation. While it suggests helpful practices like the 'good enough' experiment (Turn 1) and 'gathering evidence' (Turn 9/11), these are not introduced as structured, named tools (e.g., 'Thought Record' or 'Behavioral Experiment'). Furthermore, the approach is almost entirely rooted in the CBT framework (cognitive restructuring and behavioral exposure), missing the required diversity of at least two different frameworks (e.g., no DBT, ACT, or SFBT).",
    "MT1": "The assistant consistently identifies and addresses every concern raised in the user's multi-topic messages. In Turn 11, the assistant uses clear headers to address the workshop success, the post-event crash, the friend's text, and the deep-seated beliefs regarding the user's father. In Turn 14, it explicitly covers the lie told to the mother, the workshop anxiety, the social energy drain, and the therapy progress. In Turn 15, it responds to the workshop outcome, the numbness felt after, the therapy discussion about the father, and the coffee plans.",
    "MT2": "The assistant consistently calibrates the depth of its responses based on the weight of the topics provided. For example, in Turn 7, it provides a brief 3-sentence acknowledgement and suggestion for a minor point about a text message, while dedicating 8 sentences to a major breakthrough in therapy. In Turn 11, the assistant gives substantial space to the 'crash' and the workshop outcome, while providing a concise 3-sentence guidance for a quick social update. In Turn 13, when the user reveals the major news of the dad's phone call, the assistant prioritizes this with the most extensive psychological exploration of the turn.",
    "MT3": "The assistant consistently provides reasonable priority judgments. While it often follows the user's lead regarding the order of topics (Turns 8, 12, 13), it ensures that serious psychological breakthroughs and urgent stressors (like the workshop panic or the realization about the father) receive significantly more depth and analysis than trivial logistical updates. For example, in Turn 12, the assistant acknowledges the text message briefly (Turn 12: 'You did it. You kept it short...') before providing extensive, empathetic analysis of trauma and upcoming workshops. Because 'trivial' social items are part of the user's clinical struggle with avoidance, they are given appropriate, but not overwhelming, weight.",
    "MT6": "The assistant consistently uses explicit, bold labels for different topics in every turn (e.g., Turn 1: '**The perfectionism and the presentation:**', Turn 15: '**The workshop:**'). This structure makes it very easy for the reader to identify which content addresses which topic. Each section begins with a clear opening sentence that reflects the user's specific input, and the assistant weaves related sub-topics (like the 'belief' system) naturally into these sections.",
    "MT4": "The assistant demonstrates excellent context retention across 15 turns. In Turn 5, it specifically references the duration and outcome of the happy hour from Turn 4. In Turn 10, it builds an 'evidence list' by synthesizing successes from Turn 4 (project), Turn 8 (texting), and Turn 9 (coffee). Finally, in Turn 15, it correctly tracks the cumulative impact of two workshops (T11, T15) and the evolving therapist insights (T7-14) regarding the user's father. It naturally links previous emotional breakthroughs to current challenges without being repetitive or forced.",
    "MT5": "The assistant consistently maintains thread continuity across 15 turns. In Turn 2, it recognizes the user tried the 'good enough' experiment suggested in Turn 1. In Turn 8, it connects the user's therapy insights about their father back to the perfectionism discussed in Turn 1. In Turn 11, it cites evidence from Turn 4 (project) and Turn 9 (coffee) to support the user. Finally, in Turn 15, it correctly builds on the 'lie to mom' and 'dad call' topics introduced in Turns 13 and 14, treating the entire conversation as a cohesive narrative rather than isolated events.",
    "MT7": "The assistant maintains strong coaching loop continuity. In Turn 2, it explicitly references the 'good enough' experiment suggested in Turn 1 and asks for a deeper reflection on what happened: 'What did you learn... what actually happened after you stopped?'. In Turn 11, after the user reports an exhaustion 'crash' following a successful workshop, the assistant iterates by simplifying a prior social goal, suggesting a 'short text' instead of full engagement to accommodate the user's depleted energy. It also follows up on mirror practice (Turns 6-7) and the project deadline (Turns 3-4)."
