      "user": "So. I'm not really sure how to start this. I've been thinking about reaching out for a while, and I guess today's the day.\n\nWork has been a nightmare lately. I got passed over for a promotion I thought was mine, and now I'm watching someone with half my experience move into the role. The company's been doing layoffs all year, and I can't shake the feeling that I'm next. I've got mortgage, health insurance tied to the job, the usual. Financially I'm okay for maybe three months if things went south, which is... not great when you're my age.\n\nThe thing is, I keep telling myself it's fine. People get passed over. Companies restructure. But honestly I'm terrified. I lie awake some nights running through scenarios. Like, do I start looking now while I still have a job, or do I hold tight and hope this blows over? And if I look, what am I even looking for? The thought of interviewing, of selling myself again, it just exhausts me before I even start.\n\nMy partner thinks I should talk to someone about the anxiety, which is probably why I'm here. She's right, but also I don't know what talking about it actually changes. The job situation is what it is. But I guess that's the point, right? That I can't control the job situation but I'm spending all this mental energy trying to.\n\nAnyway. That's where I'm at.",
      "assistant": "**Work and the promotion:** Getting passed over when you thought it was yours\u2014that hits differently than people passing it off. You're not just disappointed, you're probably questioning whether you were actually ready for it or if they just... didn't see you as the right fit. The fact that someone with half your experience got it adds a layer. What does that tell you about your own value? Or is it more about the timing\u2014layoffs, restructuring, all that uncertainty?\n\n**The \"it's fine\" story:** You said you keep telling yourself it's fine, but then you also said that's the point where you can't control anything. That's actually a pretty accurate observation. You're running through scenarios at night, doing mental planning for problems that might never come, and your brain is trying to solve something that isn't solvable yet. That's exhausting. When you lie awake and run through those scenarios, what's the most common outcome your mind lands on? Starting job search immediately? Holding on? Something else?\n\n**What talking might change:** Your partner's right that the anxiety is worth looking at, and you're right that the job situation itself is external. But here's the thing\u2014the anxiety isn't just about the job. It's about control, about uncertainty, about what happens if things fall apart. The lying-awake part, the exhaustion before you even start interviewing\u2014those aren't about the job. Those are about your nervous system trying to prepare for danger that hasn't happened yet. That's where coaching can help. You don't need to fix the job situation to work on the part that's costing you energy every day.\n\nWhat would it mean to start looking at the anxiety itself, not as something to solve immediately, but just as something to understand?"

      "user": "Been a few days. Work situation got worse, which I guess proves my anxiety wasn't totally unfounded. They announced the restructure officially\u2014two more rounds of cuts coming, timeline unclear. So now everyone's in this weird limbo where nobody's talking about anything real, just pretending to work while checking LinkedIn.\n\nI did start looking at job postings, which felt productive at first. Then I opened my laptop this morning and just... stared at them. Couldn't get myself to actually apply. Kept thinking about how I'd have to explain the gap in my resume if I lose this job before finding another one, or how I'd explain why I'm leaving if I'm not being laid off. Like there's no good narrative here. Either I look desperate or disloyal.\n\nYour thing about the anxiety\u2014not being about the job itself\u2014I get what you're saying intellectually. But when the job is actively falling apart, it's hard to separate that from the \"trying to control something uncontrollable\" piece. Like, the anxiety is justified, right? This is actually a crisis situation now, not just hypothetical.\n\nI did sleep better one night last week, which was weird. Nothing changed\u2014just happened. Then the restructure announcement came and back to the lying awake thing.\n\nMy partner's been helpful but also kind of on my case about the job search. I think she wants me to be proactive and not just reactive, and I don't disagree, but it feels like pressure on top of everything else.",
      "assistant": "**The restructure and limbo:** Two more rounds of cuts coming\u2014that's a concrete thing now, not just a feeling. And the pretending-to-work-while-checking-LinkedIn thing is its own kind of miserable. You're in this in-between space where your brain knows it's real but nobody's talking about it, so you're stuck in this low-grade dread that doesn't let you go anywhere. That's a specific kind of bad.\n\n**The job postings and staring:** You opened the laptop, saw the postings, and couldn't move. That's not about productivity or motivation\u2014it's about your nervous system hitting a wall. You're trying to take action in a situation where any action feels like it'll backfire (explain the gap, look desperate or disloyal). There's no clear path forward, so your brain just... freezes. That makes sense. The anxiety isn't \"unfounded\" in the sense of being irrational, but it's also not about the job itself anymore. It's about the story you're telling yourself that makes every move feel like it'll cost you something.\n\n**The anxiety being \"justified\":** I hear you that this is a crisis now. The job is falling apart, you're not wrong to feel scared. But here's the thing: the anxiety being justified doesn't mean it's useful. Right now, you're anxious, you're staring at job postings, you're lying awake again. The anxiety is doing its job\u2014keeping you vigilant, scanning for threats\u2014but it's also preventing you from doing the very thing you need to do to get out of the limbo. That's the trap. Your nervous system is trying to protect you from something that might not happen the way you're afraid it will, and in the meantime it's costing you energy and time.\n\n**Sleep better one night:** That was real. Nothing changed externally, your brain just... let down its guard for a minute. That tells you something important: the situation isn't the only thing driving the anxiety. There's a part of it that's about how you're holding the situation inside, and that part can shift even when the external conditions don't.\n\n**Your partner's pressure:** She wants you proactive, not just reactive. I get it from her side\u2014she's probably worried and looking for reassurance that you're doing something. But it's pressure on top of everything else, which makes sense. You're already under pressure, adding \"do this now or you're failing\" to the mix isn't helping. What would help instead: understanding what \"proactive\" actually looks like from your side, not hers?\n\nOne thing that might help when you're staring at job postings and can't move: what if you applied to one job this week, just one, with the understanding that it's an experiment? Not a productive move, not a meaningful application\u2014just data. See what happens. You don't have to believe it'll work, you just have to see if your brain's freeze is the only thing stopping you."

      "user": "Ok so I did apply to one job. Just one, like you said. Sent it off Tuesday morning before I could overthink it. Haven't heard anything, which is fine\u2014I know these things take time. But the weird part is I felt... lighter that day. Not like the problem was solved, just like I'd actually done something instead of staring at the screen. So that part worked, I guess.\n\nThe rest of the week fell apart though. Wednesday morning my manager pulled me into a meeting\u2014nothing official, just \"checking in.\" I spent the next six hours convinced I was about to be let go. Turns out she just wanted to discuss a project timeline. By the time I realized it wasn't about layoffs, I was completely drained. Wasted the whole day being terrified for nothing.\n\nAnd then yesterday my partner brought up the job search again. We were just having dinner and she said something like \"so are you going to apply to more places or just the one?\" Not attacking me, just asking. But it landed like criticism. Like she thinks I'm not doing enough. I told her I'd handle it, which I know came out hostile. We didn't fight exactly, but there's this tension now where she's being careful around me and I feel like I'm failing at the job search *and* at being a good partner.\n\nThe lying awake has gotten worse actually, not better. Last night I was going through everything\u2014the restructure, my resume, whether I'm even qualified for the jobs I'm looking at, whether my partner resents me for being anxious all the time. It's like my brain won't stop. I don't know how to turn it off.",
      "assistant": "**Applying to that one job:** You did it before you could talk yourself out of it, and you felt lighter that day. That's not a small thing. The freeze was broken\u2014you acted, you sent it, and even though nothing happened yet, you got data. You learned that the brain's \"I can't do this\" isn't always the only truth. The fact that you felt lighter tells you something: action, even small action, has a weight to it. It's not the problem being solved, but it's you moving instead of just scanning for threats. That matters.\n\n**The meeting and six hours of being terrified for nothing:** Your manager wanted to discuss a project timeline, and you spent six hours convinced it was about layoffs. That's not about the meeting being bad or your manager being cruel\u2014it's about your nervous system being in overdrive. You're in a crisis situation, your brain is scanning for danger, and a normal thing (project timeline) just got caught in that scanner. You didn't waste the day for nothing. You wasted the day because your threat-detection system is doing its job too well. It's the same system that froze you when you stared at job postings\u2014it's just working in different ways now. Both times it's costing you something.\n\n**Your partner's question and the tension:** She asked if you'd apply to more places, and it landed like criticism. You told her you'd handle it, which came out hostile. Now there's this tension where she's being careful and you feel like you're failing at both the job search and being a good partner. Here's what I'm hearing: you're already carrying the weight of the job search, the anxiety, the uncertainty\u2014and she's asking you to do more while you're barely holding it together. That's not criticism, that's pressure. And when you snap at her, you're seeing it as failure, which means now you're also failing at being a partner because you can't communicate what you need. That's a double bind. She wants you to move forward, you can't, and now you're both in this space where she's careful and you're defensive. What would it look like to tell her, \"I can't do more right now, and I need you to not push me on this\"? Not as a plan, just as a thought.\n\n**The lying awake getting worse and your brain won't stop:** Last night you were going through everything\u2014the restructure, your resume, whether you're qualified, whether your partner resents you. Your brain is running threat scenarios, self-evaluation scenarios, relationship scenarios, all at once. And you said you don't know how to turn it off. You're right\u2014you can't just turn it off. But here's the thing: the rumbling isn't random. It's your brain trying to solve something that feels unsolvable by running every possible angle. The restructure, your qualifications, her feelings about you\u2014each of those is a piece of the \"what if I'm not good enough\" story. When you're lying awake and the rumbling starts, what's the first thought that comes up? Is it about the job? The next job? Her? Yourself? What does the brain think it's trying to figure out by going through all of that?\n\nOne thing that might help when the rumbling starts: next time it happens, instead of trying to stop it, try naming what it's doing. \"My brain is scanning for threats again. It's doing the thing it does when I'm stressed.\" You don't have to fix it, you just have to see it. Sometimes that's enough to create a little distance."

Not perfect, but better. So I guess I'm doing that when I notice it happening now.\n\nWork is still a mess. The restructure timeline got pushed back which should feel good but somehow doesn't. Like we're all just waiting for the axe to fall later instead of sooner, which is its own kind of torture. Everyone's energy is weird right now.\n\nOn the job search front I've applied to three more places since that first one. No responses yet, which is normal I know. But the applying part is getting easier\u2014I'm not staring at the screen as long before I just do it. Small thing but whatever.\n\nThe partner thing though. We had a good conversation a couple nights ago, and I told her I need her to ease up on the job search pressure because I'm already stressed about it. She actually listened. Said she didn't realize she was adding to it, that she was just scared too and channeling it into \"do something.\" Which made sense when she said it. Since then it's been better between us. Like the tension lifted a little.\n\nBut here's the thing I'm still stuck on\u2014and maybe this is the intellectualizing thing you'd probably call out\u2014I keep running the numbers in my head about the three-month runway if I get laid off. Like I'll be fine for three months, maybe four if I cut back, and that should theoretically feel manageable but it just doesn't. I can tell myself logically that I have options, that plenty of people have been through worse, that I'll probably land something before the money runs out. But knowing that doesn't actually change the feeling. The feeling is still there underneath.",
      "assistant": "**Naming the brain thing and sleep:** You tried \"brain is scanning for threats again\" out loud and it felt silly at first, then you slept better that night. You're doing that now when you notice it. That's real. You're not making the rumbling go away, but you're creating a little distance between you and it. That distance is what lets you rest a little. The fact that it worked even when you felt it was silly tells you something: sometimes the useful things feel dumb, and that doesn't matter. What matters is they work.\n\n**Work and the timeline getting pushed back:** The axe is falling later, not sooner, and you said that should feel good but somehow doesn't. You're right\u2014it's its own kind of torture. Waiting for something bad to happen is different from dealing with something bad happening. When it's real and immediate, you can at least react. When it's just this vague, extended dread, you're stuck in it. Everyone's energy is weird right now. You're all in that same limbo, just not sure what it means for you personally. That's a specific kind of hard.\n\n**Job search getting easier:** You've applied to three more places since that first one. The screen-staring is getting shorter, you're just doing it. That's not a small thing. You're building a pattern: apply, feel the freeze, do it anyway, and the freeze gets a little smaller each time. You're not staring at those postings as long. That's your nervous system learning that action has a different weight than paralysis.\n\n**The conversation with your partner:** You told her you need her to ease up on the pressure, and she listened. She said she didn't realize she was adding to it, that she was scared too and channeling it into \"do something.\" That made sense when she said it. And since then the tension lifted a little. That's a different kind of progress. You told her something hard, she heard it, and the thing that was costing you both got smaller. That's not nothing.\n\n**The numbers and the feeling underneath:** You keep running the numbers\u2014three months, maybe four if you cut back. Logically you know you'll be fine, plenty of people have been through worse, you'll probably land something before the money runs out. But knowing that doesn't actually change the feeling. The feeling is still there underneath. Here's what I want to say about that: the feeling is the part that matters. You can tell yourself all the logical things as many times as you want, and it won't make the dread go away. That's because the dread isn't about the numbers\u2014it's about the uncertainty. Three months is a number. What isn't a number is the fact that you don't know when the cuts are coming, whether you'll be one of them, whether you'll land something before it's too late, whether you'll be good enough, whether the jobs you're applying to will even take you. The feeling is the anxiety about the unknown. And the unknown is the part that keeps your nervous system on high alert, no matter what the numbers say.\n\nYou can't fix that with logic. But here's the thing: you're already doing the thing that might help. You applied to more places. You're talking to your partner. You're naming the brain's pattern when it shows up. Those aren't about changing the feeling\u2014they're about giving your nervous system something to do other than just scan for threats. The feeling will still be there. The question is whether you can live with it, not whether you can make it disappear."

The resume getting filtered out automatically is a real thing that happens, and it's not because you're not qualified. Algorithms pick up keywords, mismatched language, whatever.

The question you're asking is: \"What do I actually want?\" And the answer is: you're trying to figure it out by applying, by seeing what feels right and what doesn't. You're not asking it in a big, formal way, but you're asking it by doing. You're using the upheaval to test what you want by taking action. That's not too much.

Relief because it's real now, not hypothetical. Guilt because those twelve people are out of a job. Your manager said \"stable for now\" and that's supposed to be good news, but it also feels like round two is coming for you. That mix of relief and guilt makes perfect sense. Part of you is glad to have a little more information, even if it's bad information. Another part of you is grieving for those twelve people and scared that the good news for you is just a delay.

If you narrowed your focus maybe you'd actually get somewhere instead of just throwing applications at the wall. But you also don't know how to narrow your focus when you don't actually know what you want yet, so you're stuck there. Here's what I think: you're applying to enough to get data. You've got seven applications now, and you're testing the boundaries of what you want by showing up in different places. That's useful. The market being slow is real, and some of those applications will take longer than others. But the reason you're not hearing back from some of them isn't because you're spreading yourself too thin\u2014it's because hiring is slow right now. You don't need to narrow your focus to get somewhere. You need to keep applying to things that feel like they're testing the boundaries, and when you get a response, you'll have more information about what's actually possible."

I've been assuming everything was going into a black hole. Now I'm supposed to talk to someone about a role I'm not even sure I'm qualified for, which is... I don't know, terrifying and weird at the same time.\n\nThe thing is, I'm already in my head about it. Running through what they're going to ask, what I'm going to say, how I'm going to explain why I'm switching from technical work to PM when I've never actually done it before. It's like the old pattern\u2014brain scanning for all the ways this could go wrong. Except this time there's an actual thing happening instead of just the waiting.\n\nWork got worse. Round two of cuts came through today, mid-afternoon, and my team got hit. Three people, including someone I actually liked working with. My manager pulled me aside and said I'm \"not part of this round\" but the way she said it made it clear there will be a next round. So I'm still here, but now I'm watching people pack up their stuff while I'm supposed to just... keep working like nothing happened. The office is depressing right now.\n\nMy partner noticed I was quiet tonight and asked if I was okay. I said yeah, just a rough day at work, didn't go into details. She didn't push it. I know I should probably tell her about the phone screen because she's been supportive, but I also don't want to get her hopes up or have her start asking me questions about it. Like, I need to just sit with this quietly for a bit before it becomes A Thing we're talking about.",
      "assistant": "**The phone screen:** They got back to you. You got an email asking for a phone screen next week, and you're shocked because you've been assuming everything was going into a black hole. That assumption was costing you data. Now you have an actual next step, and the job market being slow is still real, but it's not the whole story. And now you're in your head about the phone screen\u2014running through what they're going to ask, what you're going to say, how you're going to explain why you're switching from technical work to PM when you've never actually done it before. That's the old pattern showing up again: brain scanning for all the ways this could go wrong. But here's the thing: this time there's an actual thing happening instead of just the waiting. You've got an opportunity to test whether you're actually qualified, and the interview is the way to find out. You don't have to have it all figured out before you walk into that call. You just have to show up and see what happens.\n\n**Round two cuts and your team getting hit:** Three people got let go, including someone you actually liked working with. Your manager said you're \"not part of this round\" but the way she said it made it clear there will be a next round. You're still here, but now you're watching people pack up their stuff while you're supposed to just keep working like nothing happened. The office is depressing right now. That's a hard thing to sit with. You're not just watching other people's lives fall apart\u2014you're also watching your own, one round at a time. The fact that she said you're \"not part of this round\" in a way that felt like a warning, not a reassurance, tells you something. There's still uncertainty, and you're holding it now. You're not part of the cuts this time, but you know the next round is coming, and that's a different kind of bad. You're in the limbo where you survived one wave but you're still waiting for the next one.\n\n**Not telling your partner about the phone screen:** You said you should probably tell her because she's been supportive, but you also don't want to get her hopes up or have her start asking you questions. You need to sit with this quietly for a bit before it becomes A Thing you're talking about. I get it. You're trying to protect her from getting too invested in something that might not work out. But here's what I'm hearing: you're also protecting yourself. You're managing the uncertainty by not letting her in on it, and that way you don't have to deal with her hopes or her questions or the pressure that comes with her being part of this. And I'm not saying you have to tell her right now. But if you do decide to share it with her at some point, it's probably going to be A Thing eventually, whether you want it to be or not. She's already noticing you're quiet, she's already asking if you're okay. You can't keep it completely separate from the relationship forever. What would it look like to tell her you got a phone screen and that you're going to handle it, without letting her take over?"

      "user": "So the phone screen happened yesterday. It was... fine, actually. Not great, but not a disaster either. I walked in expecting them to grill me on why I was switching careers or what made me think I could do PM work, but they mostly just asked about projects I've managed informally, how I handle timelines, conflict resolution stuff. Standard interview questions. I didn't feel like I bombed it. I also didn't feel like I nailed it. Just sort of... existing in the middle somewhere.\n\nThey said they'd follow up early next week about next steps, so now I'm back in the waiting game, which is its own special kind of torture. At least this time I know something could actually happen.\n\nThe thing that's been weighing on me more though is work. After the second round of cuts, there's this weird energy where nobody trusts anything anymore. People are actively looking now\u2014I can tell because they're not even pretending to hide it. My manager seems stressed in a different way, like she's trying to hold the team together while also probably getting pressure from above about productivity. The three people who got cut\u2014I found out one of them had been at the company fifteen years. Fifteen years and they still let him go. That keeps sitting with me. Like, what's the point of loyalty anymore? What's the point of showing up and doing your job well if it doesn't actually protect you?\n\nI didn't tell my partner about the phone screen ahead of time like you kind of suggested. I know I should have. But I did tell her about it after it happened, and she asked a bunch of questions about how it went, whether I think I have a shot, what the timeline is. It was fine but also felt invasive somehow, like I couldn't just have this thing that was mine to sit with for a bit. She meant well but it added this whole other layer of... I don't know, performance? Like I have to manage her investment in it too now.\n\nAnyway. Phone screen's done. Work is still a mess. Just waiting again.",

Standard interview questions. You didn't feel like you bombed it, you didn't feel like you nailed it, just existing in the middle. That's actually a pretty good sign. You didn't get thrown off by unexpected questions or feel like you were exposed as not being qualified. That's the interview going okay. You showed up, you answered, and you're in the middle\u2014neither confident nor crushed. That's about the right place to be for a first screen. They're just testing whether you fit the basics. You did, and now they're following up early next week about next steps. So you're back in the waiting game, which is its own special kind of torture.

You've got a thread now, even if it's still in the air.\n\n**Fifteen years and loyalty:** One of the people who got cut had been at the company fifteen years. Fifteen years and they still let him go. That keeps sitting with you. What's the point of loyalty anymore? What's the point of showing up and doing your job well if it doesn't actually protect you? That question is hard. You're not wrong to ask it. The answer, I think, is that it's not about loyalty anymore. Companies don't protect people because of loyalty\u2014they protect people because of economics. And fifteen years of service doesn't guarantee anything in a restructuring. That's the part of it that's real. But here's the thing: you're not going to find the answer to \"what's the point of loyalty\" by sitting with it for too long. That's a question that doesn't have a useful answer right now. What's useful is you showing up to your job, doing what you can, and knowing that your survival has more to do with the market and the company's decisions than your own performance. That's not a comfortable truth, but it's the one that's real. And it's also the thing that's letting you focus on the phone screen and the next steps instead of trying to solve something that's not yours to solve.\n\n**Your partner and the performance layer:** You didn't tell her ahead of time like I suggested, you told her after, and she asked a bunch of questions about how it went, whether you think you have a shot, what the timeline is. It was fine but also felt invasive, like you couldn't just have this thing that was yours to sit with for a bit. She meant well but it added this whole other layer of performance\u2014like you have to manage her investment in it too now. That makes sense. You wanted to sit with it alone, and now you're managing her hopes and her questions and her investment in something that's still just a thread in the air. But here's what I think: you're not wrong to feel that way. You needed space to process it, and she didn't give it to you. That's a thing you can tell her. You can say, \"I needed a minute to sit with that before I told you about it. I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier, and I think I need to manage this on my own for a bit.\" That's not attacking her. That's just clarifying what you need."

You just have to know enough to show up and be honest about what's important to you.\n\n**Not telling your partner yet and managing everyone's investment:** You haven't told her yet. You know you should, but you also just said you're tired of managing everyone's investment in this. You don't want to explain it all again. You don't want to answer questions about what this means or whether you think you'll get it or what happens if you do. That makes sense. You're already running on fumes, and you're trying to hold onto something that might not be there. Adding \"what does this mean for us\" on top of that is another layer of pressure. But here's what I think: you're not going to be able to avoid telling her forever. She's already noticing you're tired, she's already noticing you're in a holding pattern, and she's going to keep asking until you give her something. You don't have to answer her questions right now, but you're going to have to tell her about the final round interview eventually. And when you do, you can say, \"I need you to not manage my investment in this, okay? I'm going to handle it. I'll update you when I have more information.\" That's not attacking her. That's just clarifying what you need from her."

      "user": "Been thinking about what you said about telling my partner. You're right, obviously. I did tell her about the final round interview yesterday. She was happy about it, asked the questions I knew were coming\u2014do you think you have a real shot, what's the timeline, all that. I answered them and then I just... told her I needed to handle this on my own for the most part. That I'd update her when there was something to update her on. She didn't like it exactly, but she accepted it.\n\nThe weird thing is I feel a little lighter since I said that. Not because the problem is solved\u2014obviously it's not. But because I stopped pretending that I could manage both things at the same time. The job search and her investment in it and my own anxiety about all of it. I just said no to some of that.\n\nWork has been different this week. Everyone who survived round three is kind of... bonded? Like we all know we're waiting for the next axe to fall and there's something almost relieving about that. We're not pretending anymore. People are openly talking about their interviews, sharing leads, that kind of thing. It's weird but it's also the most honest the office has been in weeks. That guy who's been looking for a month finally got an interview lined up, so at least there's that.\n\nThe final round is Friday. I'm not spending all night running scenarios like I did before the second round. I'm just kind of... accepting that it's going to happen and I'll either get it or I won't. Which sounds zen or whatever but honestly I'm just too tired to catastrophize at this point. My brain's got nothing left.",

That's real. You've been carrying other people's hopes and questions on top of your own for weeks, and now you're setting a boundary. You're not going to manage everyone's investment in the PM job anymore. You're just going to handle it, and you'll update her when you need to. That's a shift. That's you protecting your own energy so you can focus on what you actually need to do. And the fact that you feel lighter tells you something: you needed that boundary, and it's working.\n\n**The office bonding and the guy getting an interview:** Everyone who survived round three is kind of bonded.

It's weird but it's also the most honest the office has been in weeks. That guy who's been looking for a month finally got an interview lined up. At least there's that. That makes sense. You're all in the same space now, and the stress is breaking down the walls. You're not hiding anymore. You're just being real with each other. That's not a bad thing. It's hard, but it's also honest. And seeing that guy get an interview is real progress for him, even if it's not for you. You're still waiting, but at least he's moving forward. That's the difference between being stuck and being in motion, even if the motion is slow.\n\n**Final round Friday and accepting it:** You're not spending all night running scenarios like you did before the second round. You're just kind of... accepting that it's going to happen and you'll either get it or you won't. That sounds zen or whatever, but you said you're just too tired to catastrophize at this point. Your brain's got nothing left. That's honest. You're not trying to solve something that doesn't have a solution yet. You're just showing up to the interview and letting it be what it is. You're not going to control the outcome, and you're not going to spend all your energy trying to predict it. You're just going to do the thing and see what happens. That's not zen\u2014that's you conserving your energy for the interview instead of wasting it on scenarios that aren't real yet. Your brain's got nothing left because you've been using it trying to solve problems that aren't yours to solve. Now you're just letting it be what it is."
