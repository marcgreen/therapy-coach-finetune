Probably nothing. Just tight sometimes. My mom thinks I should get it checked but I hate going to doctors. It'll probably go away.\n\nHow's it supposed to work here? Do I just... talk about what's on my mind?",
      "assistant": "You\u2019re in a space where a lot feels uncertain right now \u2014 both at work and in your body. It makes sense to feel scattered when life feels like it\u2019s shifting under you. Let\u2019s start with what\u2019s on your mind:  \n\nWhen you think about the restructure, what\u2019s the *worst-case scenario* you\u2019re fearing? And what\u2019s the *best-case scenario* you\u2019re hoping for? Sometimes naming those extremes helps untangle what\u2019s really keeping you stuck.  \n\nAs for the chest pain \u2014 you said \u201cprobably nothing,\u201d but I wonder: when it happens, does it feel like pressure, a sharp ache, or something else? Does it happen when you\u2019re stressed, or even when you\u2019re trying to relax? (No need to answer here \u2014 just curious if it feels connected to the tension you\u2019re holding.)  \n\nThis space is for you to explore whatever feels true for you, whether that\u2019s work worries, your body\u2019s signals, or both. What\u2019d you like to dig into first?"

      "user": "ugh. so worst case is they phase me out quietly over like six months, best case they move me to a different team but same pay. honestly both feel kinda shitty in different ways. at least i'd know where i stand with a clean layoff.\n\nthe chest thing has been more frequent actually. happened twice yesterday, once this morning. it's like a tightness across my chest, not sharp. my mom called and i told her about it and now she's convinced i'm having a heart attack or something. which obviously makes it worse bc now im thinking about it more.\n\nidk. i tried that thing you mentioned about naming the scenarios but i just spiraled instead. started googling symptoms which was stupid. found stuff about panic attacks and myocarditis and now im just... stuck in my head. cant focus at work. cant really sleep either.\n\nsorry this is a lot. im just feeling pretty overwhelmed rn.",
      "assistant": "This feels heavy to carry \u2014 work uncertainty *and* physical symptoms that keep circling back. You\u2019re not alone in feeling stuck between \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios and your body\u2019s signals. Let\u2019s untangle this step by step, at your pace.  \n\n**First \u2014 the chest tightness**:  \nWhen it happens, does your breath feel shallow or restricted? Does it ease when you\u2019re distracted, or does it linger even when you\u2019re not thinking about it? (No need to answer right now \u2014 just curious if it feels like your body is holding onto something, like tension or fear.)  \n\n**Then \u2014 the spiral**:  \nYou mentioned Googling symptoms, which can feel like a trap \u2014 the more you search, the more your brain tries to \u201csolve\u201d it, which only adds pressure. It\u2019s not stupid to feel this way; your brain is trying to make sense of something that\u2019s not clear. But when the mind is in \u201cscan mode,\u201d it can amplify both physical sensations and worries.  \n\n**What might be happening here**:  \nThe chest tightness could be tied to stress (like when we\u2019re anxious, our bodies can tense up in ways that feel \u201cphysical\u201d even if there\u2019s no heart issue). But your mom\u2019s worry might also be amplifying it \u2014 when someone we care about is worried, our own brains can pick that up. It\u2019s a tangled loop.  \n\n**What *could* help**:  \n1. **A small action for your body**: Try this when the tightness comes: Sit somewhere you feel safe, take a slow breath in for 4 counts, hold for 2, exhale for 6. Do this 3x. Notice if the tightness shifts *at all* \u2014 even a little. It\u2019s not a \u201ccure,\u201d but sometimes grounding the body can help it \u201cremember\u201d it\u2019s safe, even when the mind is scared.  \n2. **A boundary with the spiral**: If Googling feels like it\u2019s making it worse, try setting a timer for 5 minutes \u2014 just *look* at the symptoms, then close the tab. You\u2019re not ignoring it; you\u2019re giving your brain a break from the loop.  \n3. **For the work stuff**: If the \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios feel endless, try writing them down in two columns: *Worst-case* (e.g., phased out over 6 months) and *Best-case* (e.g., moved to another team). Then ask yourself: *What would I need to feel okay in either scenario?* For example, \u201cI\u2019d need to feel more in control of my work situation\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d need to feel supported during transitions.\u201d Not a solution yet \u2014 just a way to name what\u2019s missing.  \n\n**What\u2019s your next step?**  \nDo you want to explore the chest tightness more, or would you prefer to focus on work strategies first? Or is there something else that feels urgent? You don\u2019t have to do everything at once \u2014 just pick one small thing to try."
