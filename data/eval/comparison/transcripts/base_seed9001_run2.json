      "user": "ugh. ok so I've been meaning to reach out for a bit now. work's been a nightmare and I'm kind of at a breaking point with it. my manager keeps piling on deadlines that make no sense, and every time I push back I just get more work. I feel like I'm drowning.\n\nalso been having these weird chest pains off and on for like three weeks now. probably nothing but it's been in my head a lot. I know that's probably anxiety but knowing that doesn't really make it stop, you know?\n\nanyway. figured I should talk to someone about all this instead of just spiraling on my own. so. here we are.",
      "assistant": "Thank you for sharing this with me. It sounds like you\u2019re carrying a heavy load right now \u2014 both professionally and physically. I can hear how frustrating and overwhelming it feels to be stuck in this cycle at work, where pushing back only seems to make things worse. It\u2019s so important that you\u2019re recognizing the toll this is taking, even if it\u2019s hard to articulate right now.  \n\nThe chest pains are a valid concern \u2014 anxiety can definitely show up in the body in ways that feel alarming, even if they\u2019re not \u201cdangerous\u201d in a medical sense. But I also want to gently check: Have you spoken to a doctor or healthcare provider about those symptoms? Sometimes, even when we think we know what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s worth getting a professional opinion to rule out anything else. Not because I think it\u2019s likely, but because your body deserves that clarity.  \n\nOn the work front, it feels like you\u2019re in a loop where your voice isn\u2019t being heard, and the workload keeps escalating. What\u2019s one small thing you could try to break that cycle? For example:  \n- Might there be someone else at work (a colleague, HR, or a higher-up) who could help you advocate for clearer expectations?  \n- Or is there a moment in your day where you could pause and remind yourself that you\u2019re not responsible for fixing the system \u2014 just for showing up as your best self, even if that\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d for now?  \n\nI\u2019m here to sit with you through this. What feels most urgent to you right now \u2014 the physical symptoms, the work stress, or something else? You don\u2019t have to solve everything at once."

      "user": "So I went to the doctor yesterday. Got an EKG and bloodwork done. They said my heart's fine, which is... good I guess. But honestly it didn't really help? Like I still feel the tightness sometimes and now I'm just paranoid I'm missing something else. The doctor basically said \"it's anxiety\" and sent me home with a pamphlet about stress management. Super helpful.\n\nWork has somehow gotten worse. My manager scheduled this massive project kickoff for next week and didn't even tell me until today. I'm already maxed out on three other things. I told him I can't take on another project right now and he just said \"we'll figure it out\" which means I'm gonna be working weekends again.\n\nI know you asked if I could try talking to someone else about it but honestly everyone here is drowning too. There's no point. It'll just make me look like I can't handle my job.\n\nBeen sleeping like shit too. Keep waking up at 3am and then my brain just spirals about work and the chest thing. Yesterday I almost called in sick but then felt bad so I went in anyway.",
      "assistant": "Thank you for sharing more \u2014 your honesty is so important right now, even when it feels like no one is listening. I can hear how frustrating it is that the doctor\u2019s visit didn\u2019t bring the relief you hoped for. It\u2019s one thing to know \u201cit\u2019s anxiety,\u201d but another to feel like your body is still sending up red flags, and your mind is stuck in a loop of *what if*? That\u2019s a heavy weight to carry, especially when the world around you feels unkind.  \n\nAnd the work situation? It\u2019s like adding more fuel to a fire that\u2019s already out of control. Your manager\u2019s response \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019ll figure it out\u201d \u2014 feels like a dismissal, not a solution. You\u2019re not asking for a handout; you\u2019re asking for space to breathe, and that\u2019s not unreasonable. It\u2019s exhausting to feel like your voice doesn\u2019t matter when you\u2019re already giving everything you\u2019ve got.  \n\nYou mentioned being afraid that speaking up might make you look \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cunreliable.\u201d But what if we reframed that? What if, instead of trying to convince others you\u2019re \u201cfine,\u201d you tried protecting *yourself* \u2014 not to avoid responsibility, but to set boundaries that let you show up as your best self? For example:  \n- Could you write down the specific tasks you\u2019re already juggling, and then try to share that list with your manager? Sometimes, when we\u2019re overwhelmed, it\u2019s not about *adding* more \u2014 it\u2019s about *rebalancing* what\u2019s already there.  \n- Or, when the chest tightness hits, could you pause for 30 seconds and do something grounding (like noticing five things you can see, four things you can feel, etc.)? It\u2019s not a fix, but it might help your brain remember that the body is safe \u2014 even if the mind is still panicking.  \n\nThe sleeplessness is another layer of exhaustion. It sounds like your brain is on overdrive, trying to problem-solve or replay conversations. What if you tried a tiny experiment tonight? Let\u2019s say you go to bed at the same time, but before lights out, you write down *one* thing you\u2019re worried about (the chest pain, the work, the sleep, etc.) \u2014 just to give your brain a \u201ccontainer\u201d for those thoughts? Then, if you wake up at 3am, you could read that note again and say, *\u201cI\u2019ve already thought about this \u2014 I don\u2019t need to rehash it now.\u201d* It\u2019s a small tool, but sometimes our brains need a little redirection.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to \u201cfix\u201d everything right now. What\u2019s one tiny step you could try this week \u2014 either for your body, your work, or your sleep \u2014 that feels *doable*? Even something as small as a 2-minute breathing exercise when the chest tightness hits, or a 30-second check-in with yourself before bed? You\u2019re not alone in this, even if it feels that way.  \n\nI\u2019m here to hold space for all of it \u2014 the anxiety, the exhaustion, the frustration. What feels most urgent to you now?"

Didn't push back. Didn't say anything. Just let him talk over me for like 20 minutes.\n\nCame home and the chest thing came back full force. Like worse than it's been in a while.

Kept replaying the meeting over and over. Like why didn't I say anything? Why do I always just sit there and take it?\n\nMy mom called and I actually told her about the chest stuff coming back and the work meeting and she was really nice about it but also kind of worried which now has me worried about her being worried which is its own whole spiral.\n\nAnyway.

It\u2019s not weak to feel powerless in that moment, especially when the system feels unkind. You didn\u2019t push back *this time*, and that\u2019s okay \u2014 but maybe it\u2019s also worth asking yourself: *What would it look like to hold space for your frustration, even in a small way?* Not to \u201cfight\u201d your manager, but to acknowledge that *you\u2019re not okay* with how things are going. Maybe next time, you could try a tiny act of self-advocacy \u2014 not to \u201cfix\u201d everything, but to say something like, *\u201cI\u2019m feeling overwhelmed and need a moment to process this\u201d* \u2014 even if it\u2019s just to yourself.  \n\nThe chest pain returning \u2014 *\u201cworse than it\u2019s been in a while\u201d* \u2014 is a sign that your body and brain are still holding onto the weight of this.

It\u2019s not \u201cstupid\u201d to worry \u2014 when your brain is flooded with anxiety, it can feel like you\u2019re losing control, even if it\u2019s just a feeling.

Just naming it might help you feel more connected to your progress.  \n- When your brain starts to spiral about work again, pause and say to yourself, *\u201cThis is a thought, not a fact. I can notice it without being consumed by it.\u201d*  \n- Or, if you feel ready, try sharing *one* small thing about your work or chest pain with someone else \u2014 not to fix it, but just to be heard.  \n\nYou\u2019re not \u201cmagically fixed\u201d \u2014 you\u2019re still navigating a messy situation. But you\u2019re noticing the shifts, and that\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re still here, still trying, and still worthy of care. What feels like a small step you could take this week?"
