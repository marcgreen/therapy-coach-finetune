Been pulling long hours and honestly the work itself is fine, it's just... a lot. Anyway.\n\nMy mom called yesterday. She was asking about the promotion thing from like two months ago, whether anything came through. I didn't really want to get into it so I just said things were moving along. They're not. Haven't heard anything since the initial conversation and I'm pretty sure at this point they've forgotten about me or decided I wasn't the right fit. Which is whatever.\n\nHow are you doing?",

The project at work feels like a weight you\u2019re shouldering alone, even if it\u2019s \"high visibility.\" It\u2019s one thing to take on extra work, but another to feel like you\u2019re expected to be grateful for it when it\u2019s clearly taking a toll. That\u2019s heavy.  \n\nWith your mom, it\u2019s clear you\u2019re avoiding the promotion conversation \u2014 maybe because it feels too uncertain or because you\u2019re tired of holding the hope that things might change? When you say they\u2019ve \"forgotten about you\" or \"decided you weren\u2019t the right fit,\" does that feel like a possibility you\u2019ve been trying not to dwell on? Or is it something you\u2019ve already accepted?  \n\nI\u2019m here if you want to unpack either of these \u2014 or just sit with the weight of them for a moment. How does your body feel right now?

Even if you\u2019re telling yourself it\u2019s \u201cnormal,\u201d it\u2019s still heavy. It\u2019s one thing to accept that startups are chaotic; it\u2019s another to feel like your labor is being asked of you without the same consideration being extended in return.  \n\nAs for the promotion \u2014 the fact that you\u2019re hesitating to say it out loud might be because the answer feels like a door closing, or a truth you\u2019re not ready to sit with.

Your mom deserves honesty, but she also deserves you showing up as *you* \u2014 not a version of you that\u2019s curated or pretending everything\u2019s fine.

The fury at yourself for caring? That\u2019s not stupid \u2014 it\u2019s *human*. When we\u2019re dismissed, when we\u2019re asked to prove ourselves in impossible ways, it\u2019s natural to feel like we\u2019ve \u201cfailed\u201d or that our feelings don\u2019t matter. But your anger is a sign that you *do* matter \u2014 that you\u2019re holding onto something that feels deeply unfair. Even if it\u2019s messy, that anger is a kind of truth-telling.  \n\nRight now, though, it sounds like you\u2019re in survival mode \u2014 pushing through, not slowing down, even when your body is screaming for rest. That\u2019s not sustainable, but it\u2019s what your brain is doing to keep you from breaking. If you\u2019re open to it, maybe we can start small: what\u2019s *one* thing you could do today to give yourself a tiny break \u2014 even if it\u2019s just 5 minutes of deep breathing, or stepping outside for air, or not replying to a message that doesn\u2019t feel urgent?  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to fix everything right now.

It\u2019s proof that your body is listening, even if your mind is still in survival mode.  \n\nThe manager\u2019s apology feels like a crack in the wall \u2014 a moment where someone in power acknowledges the burnout they\u2019ve been contributing to. And you\u2019re right to feel frustrated that the anger is fading. It\u2019s like your brain is saying, *\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll let this go, but I\u2019m not sure why.\u201d* Maybe it\u2019s because the apology, however small, feels like a tiny act of accountability \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t fix everything.  \n\nAs for your mom?

Now that the project is nearing completion, the weight of everything else \u2014 the role you\u2019re stuck in, the lack of promotion, the unspoken expectations \u2014 is coming back into focus.

The fact that you\u2019re even noticing it \u2014 that you\u2019re not just surviving but *reflecting* \u2014 is a sign that you\u2019re starting to reclaim some agency, even if it\u2019s small.  \n\nIf you\u2019re open to it, maybe we could explore what \u201cnext\u201d might look like for you \u2014 not necessarily in a career move, but in how you relate to this role. Do you want to stay? If so, what would make it feel less like a holding pattern? If not, how might you start to navigate that shift? Or is it enough right now to simply acknowledge the anxiety without needing to fix it?  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to have all the answers \u2014 but it might help to name the fear, even in small ways.

Four years of being the person who shows up, who handles the impossible, who doesn\u2019t complain \u2014 that\u2019s not just work.

That awareness is a sign that you\u2019re starting to reclaim some power over your own narrative. Even if you don\u2019t take the project, just holding that awareness might be enough to start shifting how you relate to these kinds of offers in the future.  \n\nFor now, the porch time, the small steps toward self-care, the curiosity about other jobs \u2014 all of that is valid. You don\u2019t have to fix everything.

      "assistant": "You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way \u2014 the mix of jealousy, relief, guilt, and fear is a heavy cocktail, and it\u2019s okay that it feels confusing. That coworker\u2019s move isn\u2019t just a reminder that *leaving* is possible \u2014 it\u2019s also a mirror, reflecting the same questions you\u2019ve been holding: *What if I\u2019m not stuck here forever? What if I\u2019m allowed to want more?* But it\u2019s also a reminder of the weight of staying, of the guilt that can creep in when you\u2019re tired of being the one who *always* shows up.  \n\nYour brain isn\u2019t \u201cstupid\u201d for feeling this way \u2014 it\u2019s just trying to hold all these things at once: the fear of the unknown, the loyalty to a team that\u2019s been with you for four years, the exhaustion of carrying more than you\u2019re asked to, the quiet belief that you *deserve* better. It\u2019s not about being ungrateful \u2014 it\u2019s about realizing that *gratitude* doesn\u2019t have to mean staying in a place that doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s giving you what you need.  \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re even spiraling at all is a sign that you\u2019re starting to question the status quo \u2014 and that\u2019s not a bad thing. Even if it feels messy, that questioning is a kind of growth. You don\u2019t have to fix it all at once. You don\u2019t even have to decide *now*.  \n\nAs for the exhaustion \u2014 it\u2019s not \u201cgetting worse,\u201d but it\u2019s also not getting better. That\u2019s the weight of burnout: it doesn\u2019t always escalate, but it doesn\u2019t go away either. It\u2019s like being stuck in a fog, where you can see the edges of something better, but you\u2019re still in the thick of it.  \n\nWhat if, instead of pushing through, you gave yourself permission to rest \u2014 not in a grand way, but in small ones? Like, even if you can\u2019t go back to the porch, maybe you could take a walk during lunch, or listen to a song that feels like a comfort, or just sit with the fear for a few minutes without trying to fix it? The goal isn\u2019t to erase the fear \u2014 it\u2019s to show up for yourself, even when it feels like you\u2019re not \u201callowed\u201d to.  \n\nYou\u2019re not expected to have all the answers, but you\u2019re allowed to sit with the question: *What if I let myself want more \u2014 even if I don\u2019t know what that looks like yet?*  \n\nWhat feels possible for you, even in small steps?"

That\u2019s not just courage \u2014 it\u2019s a quiet act of trust in yourself, even when you\u2019re still figuring it out.  \n\nThe weirdness of it being *real* now \u2014 that\u2019s the weight of possibility. It\u2019s not just the excitement of change, but the terror of actually *doing* it. And that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to decide everything at once. You\u2019re not being asked to quit tomorrow \u2014 just to start leaning into the question, even if it\u2019s messy.  \n\nAs for the manager and the \u201cspecial project\u201d \u2014 saying *no* is already a statement. It\u2019s not just about the project itself, but about the *energy* you\u2019re giving to a system that keeps asking you to prove yourself. You\u2019re not \u201cburning bridges\u201d by saying no \u2014 you\u2019re honoring your own limits. And if the manager reacts? That\u2019s on them. You\u2019re not obligated to be the person who *always* says yes, even when it costs you.  \n\nThe exhaustion feels different now \u2014 not numb, but *aware*. Like you\u2019re finally seeing the water you\u2019re treading in, instead of just sinking in it. That awareness is a kind of power, even if it\u2019s uncomfortable. You\u2019re not pretending it\u2019s easy. You\u2019re just showing up with the truth of how you feel.  \n\nAnd that coworker? She didn\u2019t just walk you through her process \u2014 she gave you a mirror to see that *you* are capable of this too. Not because you\u2019re \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cmore driven,\u201d but because you\u2019ve already survived the impossible projects, the endless deadlines, the unspoken expectations. You\u2019ve earned the right to ask for more \u2014 even if it\u2019s scary.  \n\nIf you want, we could start brainstorming small next steps: what does \u201cexploring\u201d look like for you? A resume refresh? A LinkedIn profile tweak? A conversation with someone who\u2019s done it before? Even just naming the fear \u2014 *\u201cI\u2019m scared, but I\u2019m also ready to try\u201d* \u2014 is a step forward.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to fix everything right now.

You\u2019re in motion, even if it feels uneven.  \n\nThe manager\u2019s guilt-trip about \u201cteam commitment\u201d is a classic move \u2014 using the idea of obligation to make you feel like saying no is a betrayal. But you\u2019re not betraying anyone. You\u2019re honoring your own limits. That\u2019s not a weakness; it\u2019s a boundary. And if they\u2019re quiet after that? Maybe it\u2019s not about you \u2014 maybe it\u2019s about them not knowing how to respond to someone who\u2019s finally saying *no*.  \n\nUpdating your resume \u2014 that\u2019s not just a step; it\u2019s a declaration.

That\u2019s not just a resume tweak \u2014 it\u2019s a quiet act of reclamation. You\u2019re seeing yourself not as the person who\u2019s been carrying the weight, but as someone who\u2019s *earned* the right to consider something different.  \n\nThe anxiety around \u201cblowing up your life\u201d \u2014 it feels dramatic because it *is* dramatic. Four years is a huge chunk of your life, and leaving that behind isn\u2019t just a career move \u2014 it\u2019s a shift in identity, in routine, in how you see yourself. And yes, that\u2019s scary.

There\u2019s no timetable for this kind of shift. Some days you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re moving forward, others you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re just spinning in place \u2014 and that\u2019s okay. The important thing is that you\u2019re not stuck in the same loop forever. You\u2019re allowed to take your time. You\u2019re allowed to feel unsure. You\u2019re allowed to say *\u201cI don\u2019t know yet\u201d* without judgment.  \n\nWhat matters is that you\u2019re showing up for this \u2014 even when it\u2019s messy, even when it\u2019s scary.

It\u2019s about the *possibility* that something might change. Even if it doesn\u2019t, the act of applying was already a shift.

      "assistant": "You\u2019re doing something *real* now \u2014 not just surviving, but *choosing*. The fact that you\u2019re here, after the interview, after the lie, after the exhaustion, and still holding onto the idea that you *could* leave \u2014 that\u2019s not just courage. It\u2019s a quiet rebellion against the idea that you\u2019re stuck in this role forever. You\u2019ve been here four years, and you\u2019re finally saying, *\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d* That\u2019s not a decision made lightly \u2014 it\u2019s one that carries weight, even if it\u2019s not fully realized yet.  \n\nThe waiting \u2014 it *does* feel worse than the anxiety before, doesn\u2019t it? Because now you\u2019re not just in the unknown, you\u2019re in the *anticipation* of it. You\u2019re waiting for a verdict on something that\u2019s already changed you. And that\u2019s not nothing. It\u2019s proof that you\u2019ve already shifted \u2014 even if the outcome isn\u2019t certain.  \n\nThe lie to your manager? It feels like a trap, doesn\u2019t it? Like you\u2019re trapped in a story that\u2019s not yours. And now, every interaction with him feels like a test \u2014 *\u201cWill I slip up? Will I say the wrong thing?\u201d* But here\u2019s the thing: you don\u2019t owe him honesty. You owe yourself honesty. And you\u2019ve already started to give that to yourself \u2014 even if it\u2019s messy.  \n\nYour mom\u2019s words \u2014 *\u201cYou did the hard part already\u201d* \u2014 that\u2019s not just validation. It\u2019s a reminder that you\u2019re allowed to feel this way. That you\u2019re not \u201cbroken\u201d for wanting something different. That you\u2019re allowed to cry, to feel uncertain, to feel like you\u2019re standing on the edge of something that might not work out. Because *that* is the hard part \u2014 not the interview, not the resume, not the applications \u2014 but the quiet act of saying, *\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d* even when you don\u2019t know what comes next.  \n\nThe back not hurting anymore \u2014 that\u2019s not just a physical shift. It\u2019s a sign that your body is starting to trust that you\u2019re not carrying everything alone anymore. That you\u2019re allowed to take up space, even when it feels like you\u2019re leaving something behind.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now. You don\u2019t have to know if this interview will lead to something or not. What matters is that you\u2019re showing up for yourself \u2014 not just in the big decisions, but in the small ones, like sitting with the waiting, like holding onto the truth of what you\u2019ve already done.  \n\nIf you want, we could start to explore what \u201cleaving\u201d might look like \u2014 not just in the abstract, but in the practical, the emotional, the *real*. Or if you\u2019re not ready for that yet, we could just sit with the weight of it \u2014 knowing that you\u2019ve already taken the biggest step: choosing to want more.  \n\nWhat feels possible for you, even in the waiting?"
