Like everyone thinks I know what I'm doing and I'm just winging it the whole time. Been at this company almost eight years and I still get that feeling like they're gonna figure out I have no idea what I'm actually doing.\n\nAnd then there's the whole career thing. I've been thinking about switching fields entirely but that feels insane. I make decent money, got benefits, but I'm miserable most days. Some days I wake up and I'm like fuck this, I'm done, and then by 9 AM I'm just... back in it. Going through the motions.\n\nThe imposter thing is the worst part though. Like I've shipped projects that people actually use. Clients are happy. But in my head it's all luck or I just happened to be in the right place. Anyone else could've done it better. I don't know man. It's exhausting feeling like a fraud all the time when people keep telling you you're good at your job.",

I had this moment yesterday where i was explaining something technical to the team and one of them said \"yeah that makes sense\" and i wrote it down after like you said. \"they understood, the explanation was clear.\" and i felt this thing in my chest that was almost like... relief? except it also felt wrong somehow. like i'm not supposed to feel okay about doing my job.\n\nwhich is stupid when i say it out loud but it's real.\n\nanyway my manager finally asked me directly about the whole \"this is why i pushed for you\" thing. he was like \"you seem stressed, everything okay?\" and i just told him i've been feeling weird about the whole imposter thing since i took the role. and he said something that's been bouncing around in my head ever since. he was like \"malik, i've seen a lot of people in this role. you're not special because you never doubt yourself. you're good at this because you actually care about getting it right, and people feel that.\"\n\nwhich like... i don't know what to do with that. because it's almost the opposite of what i thought the problem was? i thought the thing holding me back was that i doubt myself too much but he's saying the doubt is actually part of why i'm good at it? that doesn't make sense.\n\nand then today something happened that kinda threw me. one of my team members sent me this long message about how working with me has been different than they expected. they said i actually listen to what they say instead of just deciding things and moving on. and they seemed genuinely grateful for it.\n\ni haven't responded yet because i'm still processing. but i also haven't spiraled as hard as i would've a week ago so maybe something's shifting? i don't know. some days i still feel like i'm faking it. but today's not one of those days.",
