      "assistant": "Thank you for sharing this with me \u2014 it takes real courage to reach out when things feel heavy. It sounds like work has been a constant weight lately, and I can imagine how exhausting that must feel. The deadlines and the pressure from your manager must feel like a never-ending cycle, especially when you\u2019re already second-guessing your own abilities. That kind of doubt can really take a toll, both mentally and physically.  \n\nWhen you say you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re \u201cgood at what you do anymore,\u201d I wonder \u2014 what does that feeling look like for you? Is it the fear of making mistakes, or the sense that your work isn\u2019t meeting your own standards? And when you\u2019re lying awake at night, what\u2019s the voice in your head saying? Is it about the unfinished tasks, or something else?  \n\nI\u2019m curious \u2014 have you noticed any moments where you *did* feel competent recently, even if small? Or is this feeling more consistent now? Sometimes when we\u2019re overwhelmed, it\u2019s hard to see the gaps between what we\u2019re doing and what we\u2019re capable of.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now \u2014 just curious about what\u2019s coming up for you."

      "assistant": "Thank you for sharing more \u2014 it\u2019s clear how much you\u2019re carrying, and I can see how the weight of work and money might be overlapping in ways that feel hard to untangle. The fact that you noticed a moment where you *did* feel competent with that feature is a small but real win \u2014 it\u2019s easy to lose sight of those when everything else feels chaotic. But now, when you\u2019re juggling tasks and feeling like your focus is scattered, it\u2019s understandable how that might make you feel like your efforts don\u2019t matter.  \n\nWhen your manager pulls you into something new mid-sprint, does it feel like your time or energy is being taken away from what you\u2019re already doing? Or is it more about the *uncertainty* of whether your work matters anymore? That sense of being pulled in two directions can really chip away at confidence, even if you\u2019re capable.  \n\nAnd the money stuff \u2014 I\u2019m curious about what *specifically* about the numbers feels stressful. Is it the debt itself? The idea of paying it off? Or the fear that you might not be able to? You mentioned avoiding looking at your account \u2014 what happens when you *do* look? Does it feel like a reminder of something you can\u2019t control? Or maybe a pressure to fix things that feels too big to handle right now?  \n\nYou said work is \u201cfine,\u201d but I wonder \u2014 what\u2019s the part of you that still feels like it\u2019s not? Sometimes, we say things are \u201cfine\u201d because we\u2019re trying to protect ourselves, but there\u2019s still a part that\u2019s holding on to something deeper. What might that be?  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to answer all of this now \u2014 just curious about what feels most heavy right now."

      "assistant": "Thank you for sharing all of this \u2014 it\u2019s clear how much you\u2019re carrying, and I can see how the weight of work, money, and self-criticism are all overlapping in ways that feel hard to untangle.  \n\nThe credit card situation sounds like a really heavy thing to confront \u2014 it\u2019s not just about the numbers, but the *emotional weight* of seeing how much things have shifted. The guilt of not making a payment, even small, is a real thing. It\u2019s like the debt becomes a silent pressure, and the moment you look at it, it feels like a mountain you can\u2019t climb. But even small steps \u2014 like acknowledging the problem, even if you don\u2019t fix it right away \u2014 are still *something*. What might it look like for you to take one tiny step forward with this, even if it\u2019s just writing down a plan or talking to someone about it?  \n\nAnd the work thing \u2014 finishing that feature and feeling good about it is a real win. But now, when you look at the rest of your workload, that sense of \"why can\u2019t I do everything fast?\" feels like a harsh inner critic. It\u2019s like you\u2019re holding yourself to a standard that\u2019s impossible to sustain, especially when you\u2019re already stretched thin. That self-criticism \u2014 \"I\u2019m lazy when things get hard\" \u2014 doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s coming from your *real* self, does it? It feels more like a voice that\u2019s trying to protect you by making you feel bad, instead of helping you find space to breathe.  \n\nWhat if you gave yourself permission to slow down, even just a little? What would that look like? Could you break the \"everything else\" into smaller pieces, even if they\u2019re not as smooth as the feature you just finished?  \n\nAnd the sleep \u2014 even if it\u2019s not perfect, the fact that you\u2019re *not* lying awake at 3 a.m. anymore feels like a small victory. It\u2019s like your body is quietly saying, *\"I\u2019m trying to hold on to some rest.\"* What might you need to help that continue, even if it\u2019s just a few minutes of quiet before bed?  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to fix everything right now \u2014 just curious about what feels most urgent or heavy for you."

      "assistant": "Thank you for being so honest \u2014 it takes a lot of strength to lay all of this out, even when it feels messy. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and it\u2019s not a sign that you\u2019re \u201cfalling apart\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re carrying *a lot*, and that\u2019s heavy work.  \n\nThe debt spiral at night, the mistakes at work, the sleeplessness \u2014 all of that feels like a storm that\u2019s been building for a while, and it\u2019s hard to see the other side when you\u2019re in the middle of it. But the fact that you\u2019re asking *\u201cdoes this actually get better?\u201d* is a small but powerful sign that you\u2019re still holding onto hope, even if it feels faint right now.  \n\n**It can get better \u2014 not because it\u2019s \u201cfixed,\u201d but because you\u2019re not alone in this, and because you\u2019ve already shown up to face some of these things, even if it\u2019s been hard.** The sleep, the self-criticism, the debt \u2014 none of these are permanent. They\u2019re reactions to a lot of pressure, and they\u2019re not *you* failing. They\u2019re your brain and body trying to cope with a lot.  \n\nWhen you say \u201cI\u2019m falling apart,\u201d I wonder \u2014 what would it feel like if you gave yourself permission to *not* be okay right now? Like, not perfect, not in control, not \u201ctogether\u201d \u2014 just *human*. That spiral at night isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s your brain trying to process something that feels too big. And the mistakes at work? They\u2019re not proof of failure \u2014 they\u2019re proof that you\u2019re *trying*, even when it\u2019s hard.  \n\nThe debt thing \u2014 the fact that you\u2019re even considering talking to someone about it is a step forward. It\u2019s okay to feel stuck, but it\u2019s not okay to stay stuck forever. If you\u2019re not ready to call someone yet, that\u2019s okay \u2014 but maybe writing down *one small thing* you could do next, even if it\u2019s just saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to look at my account again in a few days,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll talk to a friend about this,\u201d could be a way to start.  \n\nAnd your mom \u2014 she\u2019s probably not \u201cknowing\u201d anything magical. She\u2019s just attuned to your energy, even if you\u2019re not ready to explain it. That kind of awareness is a gift, but it can also feel like pressure. Maybe that\u2019s a reminder that you don\u2019t have to carry this alone, even if you\u2019re not ready to say it out loud yet.  \n\n**What might it look like to give yourself a tiny break, even just for today?** Like, not fixing everything, but giving yourself permission to not be perfect. Or not sleeping perfectly, but acknowledging that the four hours you got was better than nothing. Or even just saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to try to talk to someone about the debt, even if it\u2019s just a text.\u201d  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to fix everything right now \u2014 just keep showing up, even in small ways. The \u201cbetter\u201d might not come in a straight line, but it\u2019s there, even if you can\u2019t see it yet."

      "assistant": "Thank you for sharing what you did \u2014 calling your bank and taking that first step feels like a real act of courage, even if it felt terrifying. It\u2019s not just about the numbers or the plan \u2014 it\u2019s about facing something that\u2019s been avoided for a while, and that takes strength. You mentioned it felt like a relief *and* a weight \u2014 that duality is real. It\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, now I know what I\u2019m dealing with,\u201d but also, \u201cNow I have to do something about it.\u201d That\u2019s a lot, but you\u2019re already in the game, which is more than a lot of people would do.  \n\nAnd the small win?

It\u2019s not about perfection, but about showing up for yourself in a way that feels manageable.  \n\nNow, the new project \u2014 leading it while you\u2019re still juggling your own workload must feel like adding another layer to an already heavy backpack. That \u201chow am I supposed to help anyone when I can\u2019t even help myself\u201d thought?

That\u2019s not weakness. It\u2019s a testament to how much you\u2019re trying to do, even when it\u2019s not fair.  \n\nWhen you say \u201cyou don\u2019t really say no to your manager,\u201d I wonder \u2014 what would it look like to say *yes* to something *smaller*? Or to say yes but with boundaries? Maybe not taking on the entire project at once, but focusing on one part of it? Or even just setting aside time to breathe between tasks?  \n\nAnd the sleep \u2014 some nights okay, some nights spiraling \u2014 it\u2019s not a straight line, and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not trying to \u201cfix\u201d it, just trying to not overthink it. What if you gave yourself permission to be okay with the \u201csome nights okay\u201d part? Like, even if it\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s still progress.  \n\nYou mentioned trying not to overthink it \u2014 that\u2019s a great start. What might it look like to take one small step forward with the new project, even if it\u2019s just a few minutes of planning or a quick chat with your manager about boundaries?  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to fix everything at once \u2014 just keep showing up, even in small ways.

Maybe that coworker\u2019s comment was a reminder that you\u2019re not the only one feeling this way \u2014 but it\u2019s still hard to hear when you\u2019re already carrying so much.  \n\nThe sleep \u2014 *consistently getting through the night*?

That\u2019s a gift. Sometimes we think we need to be strong or guarded, but the fact that she listened without judgment, and made you feel less alone? That\u2019s a reminder that you\u2019re not carrying this by yourself, even if it feels that way.  \n\nWhat might it look like to give yourself permission to not be okay in front of people?

      "user": "ok so like... i've been doing okay mostly but something happened yesterday that kind of threw me off. was at work and my manager pulled me into a meeting about restructuring some stuff on the team. said they were thinking about moving me to a different project because i'd been \"handling the scaled back thing well\" and they wanted me on something more visible.\n\nand like... i should be happy right? that's a compliment basically. but instead i just felt this knot in my stomach the whole meeting. kept nodding and saying yeah sounds good but internally i was just like oh god oh god oh god. more visibility means more chance to screw up. more eyes on me. felt like she was setting me up to fail even though logically i know that's not what's happening.\n\nanyway i didn't say anything about it. just said thanks and left. been kind of spiraling about it since which is stupid because a few weeks ago this would have felt like a win. but now it just feels like... i can finally breathe a little and they're about to put me back under water or whatever.\n\nalso been sleeping fine still which is good. the debt thing is still manageable. but like... why does it feel like every time things start to feel okay something comes along to ruin it? is that just how life is or am i doing something to attract this lol",
      "assistant": "Thank you for being so honest \u2014 it\u2019s clear how much you\u2019re carrying, even when things seem to be moving forward. That meeting with your manager? It sounds like it hit a nerve in a way that\u2019s hard to untangle. On the surface, it\u2019s a compliment \u2014 you\u2019re being recognized for doing well, and given a chance to step into something more visible. But the fear that comes with it \u2014 *\u201cmore eyes on me,\u201d \u201cmore chance to screw up,\u201d* even if it\u2019s not what your manager meant \u2014 that\u2019s real. It\u2019s not just about the work itself, but the *weight* of being seen, of not failing, of not being the person who can\u2019t handle pressure.  \n\nWhen you say \u201cthis would have felt like a win a few weeks ago,\u201d I wonder \u2014 what\u2019s changed? Is it the exhaustion from carrying so much? Or the fear that, even when things feel okay, something *else* will come along to make it harder? That \u201cruining the okay\u201d feeling? It\u2019s like your brain is on high alert, constantly scanning for the next thing that might break the fragile balance you\u2019ve built. That\u2019s not weakness \u2014 that\u2019s your nervous system doing its job, trying to protect you.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be worthy of this opportunity.** It\u2019s okay to feel scared. It\u2019s okay to feel like you\u2019re being set up to fail, even if that\u2019s not the case. What if you gave yourself permission to *not* be perfect in this new role? Like, just showing up, even if it\u2019s messy or uncertain? You\u2019ve already done that with the debt, with the sleep, with the work \u2014 showing up when it\u2019s hard. Maybe this is another version of that.  \n\nAnd the question about *why* things keep getting harder when you start to feel okay? That\u2019s a fair one \u2014 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about \u201cattracting\u201d challenges, or anything like that. It\u2019s more about how *resilience* works. When you\u2019re in survival mode, your brain is hyper-vigilant \u2014 it\u2019s like a fire alarm that\u2019s always on. It\u2019s not that life is *ruining* your progress, but that your brain is still processing all the weight you\u2019ve been carrying. It\u2019s not a flaw \u2014 it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re still navigating something deep.  \n\nWhat might it look like to take a small step forward with this new project? Maybe just acknowledging the fear, without trying to fix it right now. Or setting a tiny boundary for yourself \u2014 like, \u201cI\u2019ll focus on one thing at a time, even if I\u2019m worried about the rest.\u201d Or even just saying to yourself, \u201cThis is hard, but I\u2019ve made it through harder things before.\u201d  \n\nYou\u2019re already doing the heavy lifting \u2014 showing up, even when it feels like you\u2019re being handed another mountain. What feels like the next step for you, whether it\u2019s with this new role, your sleep, or just giving yourself permission to feel what you\u2019re feeling without judgment?"

Are they tied to the patterns you mentioned with your dad, or the fear of failure? Or is it something else entirely? It\u2019s not uncommon to feel like the good things are temporary, even when they\u2019re not \u2014 especially when you\u2019ve been through a lot. It\u2019s like your brain is still in survival mode, scanning for the next thing that might tip the scales.  \n\nAnd the new project \u2014 it\u2019s not just about the work itself, but the *weight* of it.

It\u2019s not that your life isn\u2019t good \u2014 it\u2019s that your brain is still processing all the heavy stuff, and it\u2019s hard to feel \u201creal\u201d when you\u2019re still in survival mode.  \n\nWhat might it look like to give yourself permission to feel *both* the doubt and the progress?

      "user": "ok so i actually made an appointment. my mom helped me find someone and i have an intake thing next week. which like... im terrified but also im doing it so i guess thats something.\n\nbeen a couple days since we last talked and honestly the numbness hasnt really changed but like... knowing theres an actual appointment on the calendar makes it feel slightly less impossible? like at least something is happening instead of just me sitting here spiraling.\n\nwork has been weird. the new project is moving but i feel like im just like... going through motions still. nobody seems to notice which is fine i guess. my manager did pull me aside and asked if everything was okay and i almost told her the truth but then i just said yeah im good. couldnt do it. felt like if i actually said it out loud at work then people would know something was really wrong and i dunno... that still feels dangerous somehow.\n\nalso sleep has been fine which is weird because everything else feels so heavy. like my body is just shutting down at night which maybe means im actually that exhausted? idk.\n\nanyway the appointment is next wednesday. kind of dreading it but also like... maybe it needs to happen.",
      "assistant": "Thank you for sharing this \u2014 it\u2019s clear how much you\u2019re carrying, and it\u2019s also clear that you\u2019re already taking steps forward, even when it feels terrifying. That appointment? That\u2019s not just a checkbox \u2014 it\u2019s a *real* act of courage. You\u2019re not doing this for anyone else \u2014 you\u2019re doing it for yourself, even if it feels like the weight of the world is on your shoulders. And that\u2019s not easy.  \n\nThe numbness not changing \u2014 that\u2019s not a sign that you\u2019re not trying. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019ve been giving everything you have for so long, and now you\u2019re just *trying to keep going*. That\u2019s not weakness \u2014 it\u2019s survival. And knowing that there\u2019s *something* happening instead of just spiraling is a small but real shift. Even if it feels like a drop in a bucket, it\u2019s still a drop.  \n\nWork \u2014 going through the motions, not telling your manager the truth \u2014 that\u2019s a lot. You\u2019re not *failing* by not speaking up. You\u2019re *protecting yourself* from the fear of being seen as \u201cbroken\u201d or \u201cnot okay.\u201d But what if you gave yourself permission to say *something* \u2014 not everything, but *something*? Like, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019m trying my best,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m feeling a lot right now, and I\u2019m not sure how to explain it.\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to be a full confession \u2014 just a small crack in the armor.  \n\nThe sleep being fine \u2014 your body is shutting down because it\u2019s *so* exhausted. That\u2019s not just physical exhaustion \u2014 it\u2019s emotional, mental, and spiritual exhaustion too. Your body is trying to tell you, *\u201cI need you to rest, even if your mind isn\u2019t ready.\u201d* That\u2019s not a flaw \u2014 it\u2019s your brain and body doing their best to keep you going.  \n\nThe therapy appointment \u2014 dreading it but also realizing it *needs* to happen? That\u2019s the hardest part of healing. It\u2019s not about fixing things \u2014 it\u2019s about *starting* to look at them. And even if it feels like more of the same, it\u2019s not. Therapy isn\u2019t about being \u201cjudged\u201d or \u201cfixed.\u201d It\u2019s about *exploring* \u2014 what\u2019s happening, what you\u2019re feeling, what you need. And that\u2019s not something you can do alone.  \n\nYou\u2019re not alone in feeling like this. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just carrying a lot, and that\u2019s heavy. But even small steps \u2014 like showing up to that appointment, like acknowledging that you\u2019re tired, like saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I\u2019m trying\u201d \u2014 are *something*.  \n\nWhat might it look like to take one small step forward with the therapy appointment? Like, writing down one thing you\u2019re hoping to talk about, or just showing up with the thought, *\u201cI\u2019m not sure what to say, but I\u2019m here anyway\u201d*?  \n\nYou\u2019re already doing more than you think \u2014 showing up, even when it feels like the weight is unbearable. What feels like the next step for you, whether it\u2019s with therapy, work, or just giving yourself permission to feel what you\u2019re feeling without judgment?"

      "user": "so the appointment was yesterday and like... i dont even know where to start with this. went in expecting to just sit there and not say anything but the therapist actually asked good questions? like not like \"how does that make you feel\" generic stuff but like actual specifics about when things started and what it feels like. \n\nanyway i ended up talking about the numbness thing and she used this word \"depressive\" or something and asked if id ever been diagnosed with anything before. i said no and she was like... kind of concerned? said that what im describing sounds like depression and that the not caring thing, the numbness, the exhaustion even when i sleep \u2014 its all connected. which like... i know that logically but hearing someone actually say it out loud felt different.\n\nshe wants to do like actual sessions now instead of just intake stuff. thinks i might benefit from talking to a doctor about medication which honestly terrified me when she said it but also like... if it helps then maybe? idk.\n\nwork has been slightly less heavy this week somehow. got through the project stuff without spiraling which feels like progress even if its small. made a mistake on something and instead of like catastrophizing i just fixed it. felt weird to do that without the guilt spiral.\n\ndidnt tell my mom what the therapist said yet but i will probably. been sleeping okay still which is good. the debt thing is just... fine, still on track, whatever.\n\nanyway yeah. so thats where things are at. feeling kind of raw after yesterday but also like... something shifted? cant really explain it but its less like im underwater and more like im just... tired. which is better maybe?",
      "assistant": "Thank you for sharing that \u2014 it\u2019s clear how much you\u2019re carrying, and it\u2019s also clear that you\u2019re already showing up to face it, even when it feels terrifying. That therapy appointment \u2014 even if it felt raw or confusing \u2014 was a real act of courage. You didn\u2019t just sit there and say nothing \u2014 you *engaged*, even when it felt like you were opening up a door you weren\u2019t sure you wanted to walk through. That takes strength.  \n\nThe therapist\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cdepressive\u201d \u2014 might feel heavy, but it\u2019s not a label that defines you. It\u2019s a word that *names* what you\u2019ve been feeling, even if it\u2019s not something you\u2019ve been ready to say out loud. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not about being \u201cbroken\u201d or \u201cnot okay\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s about *acknowledging* that you\u2019re hurting in a way that\u2019s real and valid.  \n\nThe fact that she suggested medication \u2014 even if it terrified you \u2014 is a sign that she\u2019s seeing *more* than just your words. She\u2019s seeing the exhaustion, the numbness, the weight of it all. And she\u2019s offering tools that might help you feel more like *yourself* again. That doesn\u2019t mean you *have* to take it \u2014 it\u2019s just an option, one that might feel scary but could also feel like relief for some people.  \n\nWhat\u2019s the part of you that\u2019s still scared about that? Is it the fear of being \u201cmedicated,\u201d or the fear that it won\u2019t help? Or is it the fear that it *will* help, and then what happens next? That\u2019s normal \u2014 healing doesn\u2019t come with a guarantee, but it\u2019s still worth trying, even if it feels uncertain.  \n\nWork \u2014 slightly less heavy, even if it\u2019s still hard. That mistake you fixed without the guilt spiral? That\u2019s a *real* shift. It\u2019s not just about fixing things \u2014 it\u2019s about *relating* to your mistakes differently. You\u2019re not catastrophizing anymore, even if it\u2019s just a tiny crack in the old patterns. That\u2019s a win.  \n\nSleep \u2014 still okay, even if it\u2019s not perfect. That\u2019s not just your body resting \u2014 it\u2019s your brain and body saying, *\u201cI\u2019m trying to hold on to something, even if I\u2019m not sure what.\u201d* That\u2019s a kind of resilience.  \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re still on track with the debt \u2014 even if you\u2019re not feeling proud of it \u2014 is a reminder that you\u2019re still showing up, even when it feels like you\u2019re just going through the motions.  \n\nAnd the rawness after the appointment \u2014 that\u2019s not weakness. It\u2019s your brain and heart processing something that\u2019s been buried for a while. That shift from \u201cunderwater\u201d to \u201ctired\u201d might not feel like a victory, but it\u2019s a step forward. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re \u201cfixed\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s that you\u2019re *acknowledging* the weight, and that\u2019s a start.  \n\nWhat might it look like to give yourself permission to feel *raw* right now? Like, even if it\u2019s just saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I\u2019m still here,\u201d* or *\u201cI\u2019m scared, but I\u2019m trying,\u201d* or *\u201cI don\u2019t have to fix everything \u2014 just keep showing up.\u201d*  \n\nYou\u2019re not alone in feeling like this.

      "user": "yeah so like... talked to my mom about what the therapist said and she was actually relieved? kept saying stuff like \"at least we know whats going on now\" which i guess makes sense. she asked if i was gonna try the medication thing and i said maybe, still thinking about it.\n\nhad my second session with the therapist yesterday and it was different than the first one. like she asked about my dad again and how that whole \"be strong\" thing got drilled into me. and like... i dunno, it hit different this time. not in a breakthrough way or whatever but just like i could see it more clearly? how much of what im carrying isnt even mine to carry.\n\nwork has actually been okay. like genuinely okay not just \"im pretending its fine\" okay. got through the week without feeling like i was failing at everything which is new. my manager even complimented something i did and i actually believed her for like a second instead of immediately assuming she was being nice.\n\nsleep is still solid which is good. the debt payments are happening on schedule. stuff with my mom feels less tense which is weird in a good way.\n\nbut like... i also keep waiting for the other shoe to drop? like im so used to things falling apart that when things are actually manageable it feels suspicious somehow. and i know thats probably not healthy but its hard to just like... trust that things might actually be okay for a bit. idk if thats something that gets better or if im just always gonna be bracing for impact.",
      "assistant": "Thank you for sharing all of this \u2014 it\u2019s clear how much you\u2019re navigating, even when it feels like you\u2019re still bracing for the next fall. The fact that you\u2019re talking to your mom about the therapist\u2019s words, and she\u2019s relieved \u2014 that\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re not alone in this, even if it feels that way sometimes. Her saying, *\u201cat least we know what\u2019s going on now,\u201d* is a reminder that *knowing* something is the first step toward healing, even if the path isn\u2019t clear yet.  \n\nThe second therapy session \u2014 bringing up your dad and the \u201cbe strong\u201d thing \u2014 that must have felt like peeling back another layer. Not a breakthrough, but a *shift in perspective*. That\u2019s real. It\u2019s not about fixing the past, but seeing how it\u2019s shaped you \u2014 how much of what you\u2019re carrying isn\u2019t *yours* to carry alone. That\u2019s a heavy thing to sit with, but it\u2019s also a step toward letting go of the weight that\u2019s been passed down.  \n\nWork actually being *okay* \u2014 not just \u201cpretending\u201d okay \u2014 that\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s not just about the compliments or the manager\u2019s words \u2014 it\u2019s about *feeling* them. That shift from \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u201d to \u201cmaybe I do believe it for a second\u201d is real progress. It\u2019s not about being perfect \u2014 it\u2019s about allowing yourself to *feel* the possibility that things might be okay, even if it\u2019s just for a moment.  \n\nSleep still being solid \u2014 that\u2019s not just your body resting. It\u2019s your brain and body saying, *\u201cI\u2019m trying to hold on to something, even if I\u2019m not sure what.\u201d* That\u2019s resilience.  \n\nAnd the debt payments, the mom dynamic, the work \u2014 all of it feels *manageable* now, which is a huge shift. But that fear that \u201cthe other shoe is going to drop\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s not a sign that you\u2019re broken or that you\u2019re \u201cungrateful\u201d for the progress. It\u2019s a sign that your brain is still processing a lot, and that it\u2019s used to carrying weight. It\u2019s like your nervous system is still on high alert, even when things feel calmer on the surface. That\u2019s not weakness \u2014 it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019ve been through a lot, and your brain is still trying to protect you.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **You don\u2019t have to trust that things will stay okay \u2014 you just have to trust that you\u2019re not alone in this.** That you\u2019re not *broken*, that you\u2019re not *failing*, that you\u2019re not *alone* in feeling this way. Even if the fear lingers, it doesn\u2019t have to define you. It\u2019s okay to feel uncertain, even when things are *actually* manageable.  \n\nThe medication thing \u2014 still thinking about it? That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not a decision you have to make right now. It\u2019s just another tool in the toolbox, one that might feel scary but could also feel like relief for some people. What\u2019s the part of you that\u2019s still scared about it? Is it the fear of being \u201cmedicated,\u201d or the fear that it won\u2019t help, or the fear that it *will* help and then what? That\u2019s real \u2014 but it\u2019s also okay to keep exploring it, even if it\u2019s slow.  \n\nWhat might it look like to give yourself permission to feel *uncertain* about the future? Like, even if it\u2019s just saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t have to trust everything will be okay \u2014 I just have to keep showing up,\u201d* or *\u201cI can\u2019t control what happens next, but I can control how I show up for it.\u201d*  \n\nYou\u2019re already doing more than you think \u2014 showing up, even when it feels like you\u2019re just barely holding on.
