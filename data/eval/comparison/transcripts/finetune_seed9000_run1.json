      "user": "Work's been a nightmare. My manager pulled me into a meeting yesterday about some client feedback, and I just... froze. Couldn't articulate anything. She was asking what I thought about their concerns and I just sat there. Afterwards I kept replaying it, thinking about how incompetent I looked.\n\nAnyway. Been meaning to reach out. How does this usually work?",
      "assistant": "\u6c1b\u56f4\n**Work meeting freeze-up:**\n\nThat moment of freezing\u2014where your mind goes blank and everything clicks to slow motion\u2014that's actually really common, even for people who handle pressure well. The fact that you're replaying it afterward tells me your brain is trying to make sense of what happened and figure out how to avoid it next time. That's not incompetence\u2014that's your threat system doing its job.\n\nWhat comes up for you when you imagine that moment again? Were you worried about what she thought, or something else?\n\n**How this works:**\n\nThis is straightforward\u2014this is where you share what's on your mind, and I respond. Some people want to dig into feelings and explore; others want practical strategies; some just need a place to say out loud what's happening without judgment. I'll ask questions when I'm curious, and sometimes I'll offer a frame or a reflection back.\n\nYou're in the driver's seat. What feels most useful to focus on right now?"

      "assistant": "**The meeting loop:**\n\nWhat you're describing\u2014being able to think clearly in your head but losing it in the moment\u2014is actually really common, especially when there's a lot of anxiety underneath. Your brain is so worried about \"saying the wrong thing\" that it's working overtime to protect you from failure. The problem is, that protection makes the very thing you're trying to avoid (freezing, not being able to articulate) more likely to happen.\n\nThere's something interesting about that dynamic you caught: \"if I say something wrong, it proves I am incompetent.\" That's not just anxiety\u2014that's a belief about who you are. And beliefs like that don't change in a meeting; they show up in how you interpret what happens. So if you freeze, the belief tells you \"see, I knew I was incompetent,\" which makes the next meeting even scarier.\n\nOne thing that might help\u2014this is something you can try before the next meeting: **write down 3-5 things you want to say beforehand.** Not a script, just a few points. Then, before the meeting starts, say them out loud to yourself. Not to anyone else\u2014just to you. This isn't about making you sound perfect; it's about giving your brain a small foothold so it doesn't have to start from scratch when your manager asks you a question. Your brain goes blank because it's working too hard to protect you. This gives it something to stand on.\n\nWhat would it feel like to try that before the next meeting?\n\n**Getting through the day:**\n\nThat's actually something\u2014not small. You got through a day where your brain was working against you and you didn't have another full-blown freeze. That's not nothing."

      "user": "So I tried the thing you said. Wrote down some points before a meeting with my manager today. And like... it actually helped? I could reference them when my brain started going foggy. Didn't freeze this time.\n\nBut then after the meeting ended I just felt exhausted. Like I'd been holding my breath the whole time. And I keep thinking about how I probably sounded robotic or like I was reading off a list. Which defeats the purpose right? If I have to script myself just to function that's not really solving anything.\n\nAlso my mom called yesterday asking when I'm coming to visit. I haven't seen her in months. I told her maybe next month but honestly the thought of being around her and my sister for a weekend makes me want to crawl out of my skin. She'll definitely have opinions about my job situation, and my sister will be all cheerful and successful which just makes me feel worse. So like... is avoiding that better or worse? Idk.",
      "assistant": "**The meeting:**\n\nThat's real progress\u2014you didn't freeze. And yeah, using notes can feel like you're \"cheating\" or \"being robotic\" at first, but here's the thing: you just got through a hard situation. That's what matters right now, not whether you felt perfectly spontaneous. \n\nThe exhaustion you're feeling\u2014like you've been holding your breath\u2014that's your body catching up to the stress of that meeting. That's normal. It doesn't mean you're broken or that this approach won't work again. It just means your nervous system was working overtime today.\n\nAs for sounding robotic: you're more worried about how it *felt* than how it actually went. If your manager didn't notice anything off, or if she thought you were clear and helpful, that's the reality. Your fear that you sounded fake is your brain doing its usual thing\u2014scanning for danger. It's not evidence.\n\nOne thing to try: next time you use notes, make one or two of the points intentionally more informal or conversational. Not a full script\u2014just a few words you can throw in. See if that helps you feel a little less like you're reading.\n\n**Your mom and the visit:**\n\nThe dread you're feeling about that visit\u2014I'm curious about something: when you imagine being around your sister, what's the story your brain is telling you? Like, what does \"being cheerful and successful\" mean for her, and what does it mean for you? Sometimes when we're comparing ourselves to others, it's not really about them\u2014it's about the version of us that we're holding ourselves to.\n\nAnd then there's the avoidance question: is avoiding her better or worse? That's hard to answer because both avoidance and showing up when you feel awful can leave you feeling stuck in the long run. But here's the thing\u2014you don't have to decide right now what to do about the visit. You can just notice: \"I feel dread when I think about this.\" That's enough for now. You don't have to force yourself to say yes or no, or to figure out what the right answer is."

      "user": "been avoiding thinking about the visit but my mom texted again today. she's actually hurt i haven't come see her. that made me feel like shit. so now i'm stuck between feeling bad about myself for avoiding her and feeling bad about myself for not being \"enough\" when i'm around her. which is... fun.\n\nwork meeting went okay though. used the notes again but didn't feel as robotic. still exhausted after but less? idk.\n\nthe sister thing though. i think when i'm around her i just disappear. like she takes up all the oxygen in the room with how put-together everything is for her. new job, new apartment, she's just... glowing. and i'm sitting there feeling like i'm forty and still figuring out basic shit. anyway that's probably not that deep.",
      "assistant": "**Your mom:**\n\nThat text landed hard\u2014not just because it's hurtful, but because it's confirming something about how you see yourself. When someone you love says you're not coming to see them and it's \"because of me,\" that's a gut punch. And now you're holding two stories that both feel true: \"I'm avoiding her because the visit feels bad\" and \"I'm avoiding her because I'm not enough.\" That's exhausting, and it's also probably not accurate. Most people don't avoid someone because they're fundamentally insufficient\u2014they avoid because something specific feels hard.\n\nOne thing that might help here: what would it mean to tell your mom something true about what being around for a weekend feels like for you? Not \"I'm busy\" or \"maybe later\"\u2014but something like \"being there for a few days is hard for me right now, and I want to be honest.\" Does that feel possible, or does it feel like admitting something you're not ready to say?\n\n**Work:**\n\nThat's actually real progress\u2014less exhausted, and the notes feeling less robotic. That's not just luck or circumstance; you're building a way to function under pressure that works for you. It's not going to make you feel perfectly calm or spontaneous, but it's keeping you steady. That's the goal right now.\n\n**Your sister:**\n\nI don't think this is shallow. I think it's real, and it's worth sitting with. When you say she \"takes up all the oxygen in room with how put-together everything is for her\"\u2014that's not about her. That's about the contrast she creates with the version of you that you're holding yourself to. And when you describe her as \"glowing\" while you feel like you're \"forty and still figuring out basic shit\"\u2014that's your brain comparing you to someone else's highlight reel.\n\nHere's the thing: her new job, new apartment, and glow don't tell you anything about where you are. They tell you about where she is. And you're allowed to be where you are. The question isn't whether you're \"figuring out basic shit\"\u2014it's whether you're willing to be where you are without making that feel like evidence of being broken or behind.\n\nWhat would it look like to notice her success without needing it to mean something about you?"

      "user": "so i actually texted my mom back. told her some of it\u2014not everything, but that being around the family stuff feels hard right now and i wasn't trying to hurt her. she was... okay about it? said she gets it. which is weird because i expected her to push back or get defensive.\n\nanyway. work's still fine. using the notes thing still helps but i'm wondering if that means i'm just dependent on them now? like if i stop using them will i just freeze again. feels like i'm just delaying the real problem instead of fixing it.\n\nalso had this moment yesterday where my sister posted some thing on instagram about how proud she is of her team and it just... made me want to throw my phone. not even rational. and i couldn't stop thinking about it for like an hour. kept comparing myself to her. and then i felt stupid for caring about instagram of all things. so now i'm annoyed at myself for being annoyed. which tracks.",
      "assistant": "**The text with your mom:**\n\nThat took real courage\u2014not to defend yourself perfectly, but to be honest about what's hard. And her response? That's not a small thing either. She didn't push back or make it about her hurt feelings. She said she gets it. That doesn't erase the original dread or the avoidance, but it does tell you something: the story you were carrying about her (\"she'll be hurt and it'll be about me\") wasn't the whole story. She's a bit more flexible than you gave her credit for. That's useful information.\n\n**Work and the notes:**\n\nI want to push back on the framing: you're not \"dependent on them\" and you're not \"just delaying the real problem.\" The real problem isn't that you're using notes\u2014it's that you're using them in a context that's still stressful and anxiety-provoking. That's not a failure of the notes; it's a sign that something else needs to shift.\n\nHere's what I'm curious about: the exhaustion you feel after these meetings\u2014how much of that is about the meeting itself versus the fact that you're walking on eggshells the whole time? If you're still holding your breath, if you're still scanning for \"did I say something wrong,\" the notes aren't the problem. The problem is that your manager's presence still feels like a threat. That's the place to look.\n\nOne thing you could try: pick one meeting where it's okay to be a little bit imperfect. Maybe the stakes are lower, or the relationship with your manager feels less charged. And before that meeting, instead of using notes, just notice what happens. Not to test yourself or prove anything\u2014but just to gather data. What does your brain do? How does your body feel? Sometimes we need to see what actually happens before we can figure out what's working and what's not.\n\nDoes that feel possible, or does it feel like too much right now?\n\n**Your sister's Instagram post:**\n\nThat hour of spiraling after seeing her post\u2014that's not irrational. That's your brain doing what it does: scanning for evidence about where you stand. And the fact that you felt stupid for caring about Instagram of all things\u2014well, that's just another layer of self-judgment you're adding on top of the comparison spiral. You're not \"annoyed at yourself for being annoyed\" because there's something wrong with you. You're annoyed because seeing her glow makes you feel like you're not where you want to be, and then you're annoyed at yourself for feeling like that.\n\nHere's the thing: she posted that because it matters to her. She's proud of her team and she wants to share that. It's not a trap or a test. It's her life. And you don't have to feel \"forty and still figuring out basic shit\" just because she's posting about pride and accomplishment. Those aren't mutually exclusive things. You can be working on something and still have it matter to you.\n\nWhat would it feel like to just let that post be hers without needing it to mean something about you?"

      "user": "ugh ok so that lower stakes meeting thing you mentioned? had one yesterday. smaller group, just going over some timeline stuff. and like... i didn't use notes. just went in.\n\nit was fine. not perfect but actually fine. didn't freeze, said what i needed to say. felt weird not having the safety net but also less exhausting after? which is confusing because i thought i needed the notes to function.\n\nanyway. the instagram thing is still bothering me but for a different reason now. i've been thinking about what you said about it being hers and not about me, and i get that intellectually. but here's the thing\u2014i actually really like my sister most of the time. we text, she's funny, she gets my sense of humor. and then i see something like that post and i just feel... resentful? like she doesn't deserve to feel that good about herself when i'm struggling. which is a pretty shitty thing to think about someone you care about. so now i'm annoyed at myself for having that thought, which is different from the instagram thing. is that better or worse?\n\nalso haven't called my mom back about the visit yet. keeping that option open i guess.",
      "assistant": "**The meeting:**\n\nThis is actually huge\u2014not just that the meeting went fine, but that you noticed the difference. You said it yourself: \"not having the safety net\" but \"less exhausting after.\" That's not confusing at all. The notes were working, but they were working *around* the anxiety, not in your nervous system. When you used the notes, you had a foothold, but you were still braced for disaster the whole time. When you went in without them, you were just... there. Still nervous, but not holding yourself back from being present.\n\nThat shift\u2014less exhausting even though you felt weird without the safety net\u2014tells you something: the notes weren't solving the problem. They were managing the symptoms. And the fact that you could do the meeting without them and it was \"actually fine\" means your nervous system is more flexible than you thought. That's not a small thing.\n\n**The resentment toward your sister:**\n\nI'm glad you're sitting with this instead of rushing past it. The fact that you can notice \"I actually really like my sister most of the time\u2014we text, she's funny, she gets my sense of humor\" *and* feel resentful when she posts something about pride\u2014that's not contradictory. That's just what comparison does. It creates a double bind where you can't fully have someone's success without feeling like it makes your struggle harder to bear.\n\nBut here's the thing: \"she doesn't deserve to feel that good about herself when I'm struggling\"\u2014that's not true. She's allowed to feel proud of her team, just like you can feel proud of what you're working on. Her pride doesn't take away from your struggle. It doesn't make your life harder or your stuff less important. You're making it mean something that it doesn't.\n\nThe resentment isn't about her. It's about the story you're telling yourself: \"her success makes my struggle bigger, and I can't have both.\" That's not a resentment she owes you. That's a story you're carrying. And it's doing a lot of work to make you feel small when she's doing well.\n\nWhat would it feel like to let her feel proud of her team *and* let you feel okay about your own stuff? Not the same, just both existing at the same time.\n\n**Your mom and the visit:**\n\n\"Keeping that option open\" is fine. You don't have to decide right now. But I'm curious: what's the fear that's keeping you from calling her back? Is it that you still don't know what you want to say? Or is it something else?"

And your manager asked for your input and you had thoughts and said them. That's not small. That's evidence that the notes weren't the problem\u2014that was just a tool to get you through a specific kind of anxiety. And now, in a context that's still charged but maybe a little less threatening, your nervous system is starting to trust that you can just be present.\n\nThe fact that it feels \"normal-ish\" is actually the goal. You're not performing, you're not bracing for disaster. You're just showing up as you are. That's what functioning under pressure looks like when you're not holding yourself back.\n\n**Thanksgiving and the dread:**\n\nHere's what I'm noticing: you called her back, you committed to four days, and now you're feeling trapped. The trap isn't really the visit though\u2014it's the story you're telling yourself about it. You said she was actually nice about everything, but you're already dreading it. That gap\u2014between what happened in the call and what you're feeling right now\u2014tells me something.\n\nWhat's the dread actually about? Is it the four days themselves? The family stuff? Being around your sister? Or is it something else? Because there might be a way to hold the visit without being trapped by the dread. Not right now, but maybe in a few weeks when the actual time comes.\n\nOne thing you could try: instead of \"I'm dreading Thanksgiving and there's nothing I can do about it,\" what if you said \"I'm dreading Thanksgiving and I don't know what I need yet\"? That's not giving up. That's just naming that you're still figuring it out.\n\n**The sister loop:**\n\nThis is where it gets hard, and you're naming it accurately: awareness of the thought \u2192 guilt about having it \u2192 annoyance at the guilt \u2192 exhaustion. That's not a loop you're stuck in because you're doing something wrong. That's just what your brain does when it's scanning for threats and moral correctness at the same time.\n\nHere's the thing: seeing her thrive doesn't \"highlight how much you're not.\" It's just a contrast. And the contrast is real, but it's not evidence that you're fundamentally behind or broken. It's just that she's where she is and you're where you are. You can both be okay with that without needing to make her success shrink to fit your struggle.\n\nThe guilt you're feeling about the resentment\u2014that's doing a lot of work. It's keeping you small, it's making you feel bad for existing in the same space as someone who's doing well, and it's draining you. But here's what's actually true: she can feel proud of her team and you can feel okay about your own progress. Both can be real. Both can be hers and yours.\n\nThe exhaustion you're describing\u2014the awareness-guilt-annoyance loop\u2014that's the cost of judging yourself for feeling things.

That's your nervous system running on overdrive and looking for threats in the dark. And you're right that it's making everything harder. The work wins feel less real, the dread about Thanksgiving feels heavier, and you're just more exhausted than you need to be.\n\nHere's the thing about those 3am spirals: your brain is doing what it does when it's stressed and there's no real outlet for the stress. It's scanning for problems, replaying conversations, second-guessing. It's trying to make sense of everything so you can feel safe. But at 3am, when you're alone and your body is already tired, that scanning is relentless.\n\nOne thing that might help: when you wake up and your brain starts spinning, try this\u2014instead of fighting it or trying to make it stop, just write it down. Even if it's just a few words: \"thanksgiving is hard,\" \"said something at work,\" \"worrying about sister.\" Just get it out of your head and onto paper. Not to solve anything, just to give your brain something to do besides loop. Sometimes that's enough to break the spiral and get back to sleep.\n\nDoes that feel doable, or does even that feel like too much right now?"

That tells you something about who she is, and it also tells you something about what it's like to be honest with someone who's willing to listen.\n\nThe fact that it felt \"terrifying but also kind of good\" makes sense. You're stepping into something you've been avoiding, and that's hard. But you're also getting data: telling her didn't blow up the way your brain was warning you it would. She didn't make it weird or judge you. She just wanted to understand. That's useful information.\n\n**The 3am writing:**\n\nIt helped some, you still woke up at 4, but you didn't spend an hour spiraling\u2014that's real. You're not trying to make it disappear, you're just trying to find something that works. The fact that you still woke up again doesn't mean you're doing it wrong. It just means the tool isn't perfect, and you're still in the process of figuring out what helps and what doesn't.\n\nOne thing you could try: instead of writing at 3am, try something that engages your body when you wake up\u2014like a small movement. Get up, drink some water, sit for five minutes. Sometimes your nervous system needs something physical to shift, not just cognitive. It's not about making the thoughts stop\u2014it's about giving your body a different signal.\n\nBut here's what I'm more curious about: the sleep is still shit, and you're wondering if it's just going to be like this until Thanksgiving or if you're doing something wrong. What do you think is making it worse? Is it the anticipation of the visit itself, or is it more general?"

      "assistant": "**The sleep:**\n\nThat's actually real progress\u2014marginal, but real. You found something that works better than writing, and you've been doing it consistently for three days. The fact that you're waking up but feeling less panicked is the shift. That's not \"good enough yet,\" but it's movement. And the way you're describing it\u2014\"I can function\"\u2014tells you something: you don't need to fix this overnight. You just need a way to get through the night that's sustainable. That's what you've built.\n\n**Telling your sister:**\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. She didn't call expecting you to tell her something\u2014you said it yourself, she asked how you were doing, and the way she asked made you feel safe enough to be honest. And then she said something you didn't expect: \"I used to have that too before my current job.\" That's not just her being nice. That's her recognizing herself in you and offering you something real: she's been there too.\n\nThe way you're describing the resentment feeling different now\u2014\"smaller, weird because logically I knew she's human but hearing her say it out loud just hit different\"\u2014that's not weird. That's just what happens when we see the contrast between the image we've been holding and the reality. She's not the effortlessly thriving person who's been making you feel small. She's someone who's struggled and survived. And that changes everything.\n\n**Thanksgiving:**\n\nThe dread is still there, but it's not suffocating anymore. It's \"okay this is hard but maybe I can actually be there instead of just performing.\" That's a real shift. You're not trying to make it feel good or fix the dread\u2014you're just acknowledging it and moving toward something. That's the difference between avoidance and engagement. And it sounds like you're doing both: preparing (telling your mom, telling your sister) and still feeling the hard parts. That's not a failure. That's just what it looks like to be human and show up for something that's hard."

      "assistant": "**Thanksgiving:**\n\nYou said you were braced for the performance thing, but you couldn't keep it up. And then you told your sister the actual truth instead of the sanitized version. And your mom just listened. That's not a small thing\u2014that's you choosing to be real in a context where you've been hiding for a while. The fact that it felt \"huge\" to you tells me it was hard, but it was also right.\n\nThey both listened. That's the opposite of what you were expecting, and it's also exactly what you needed. You gave them something real, and they didn't make it weird or try to fix you. You just got to be who you are. That's what it looks like when you're honest and people meet you there.\n\n**The resentment being quieter:**\n\nYou can see her being proud of her team and also see that you're doing okay with your stuff even if it's different. That's the shift. You're not competing anymore. You're just both existing. It doesn't happen automatically, but you can do it when you notice it. That's not a failure\u2014that's just how it works. You're building a new way of seeing, and it's not going to replace the old way all at once. It's going to take time and practice. And you're already doing it.\n\n**Work anxiety is basically gone:**\n\nThat's not just a small thing\u2014that's a real transformation. You're not using notes, you're not freezing, and you're just showing up. And you're right that it feels \"weird to say out loud\" because you're used to the anxiety running the show. But here's what's actually happening: the panic is quiet, and you're making room for yourself to just do the work. That's what functioning under pressure looks like when you're not holding yourself back from being present.\n\n**Sleep:**\n\nThe 3am thing happens once a week instead of every night, and when it does you know what to do with it so it doesn't feel as terrifying. That's not just marginally better\u2014that's sustainable. You've built a way to handle the hard moments without them taking over. That's progress.\n\n**The \"going through the motions\" thing:**\n\nThis is the thing that's making you feel tired. You got through the panic and the avoidance and the anxiety is quiet, but now you're noticing that your job doesn't feel like yours anymore. You're just going through the motions. And you're wondering if that's just what happens after the anxiety quiets down or if it's something you actually need to pay attention to.\n\nHere's what I think: you're noticing something real. The anxiety was a symptom, and it's been loud enough that it was running the show. But now it's quiet, and what was underneath it is showing up. You're not just doing the job\u2014you're wondering if the job is actually something you want to be doing, or if you've just been surviving it while the anxiety kept you going.\n\nThat's not a small thing to notice. That's you asking the right question: \"Is this work actually mine, or have I been going through the motions because I needed to?\" And I don't think you need to answer that right now. But I do think it's worth sitting with. What would it feel like to explore what \"my job actually feels like\" versus \"what does my job look like when I'm not in survival mode\"?\n\nYou don't have to decide anything today.

      "assistant": "**The engaged moment:**\n\nThat hour of feeling present during the project planning thing\u2014that's not a small thing. You weren't just going through the motions. You were actually *there*, seeing possibilities, imagining how you'd do it differently. And then it faded and you were back to autopilot. That contrast\u2014engaged for an hour, then back to autopilot\u2014tells you something real. The engagement isn't random. It showed up because you found something that felt like it was yours, and then it disappeared because the rest of the context wasn't holding that for you.\n\nThe fact that it made you think \"maybe it's just me\u2014maybe I'm incapable of being satisfied or engaged with anything\" is your brain trying to make sense of something. But here's what's actually happening: you had one hour of genuine presence, and that was enough to start asking the bigger question. You're not broken. You're just noticing that the job isn't giving you what you need, and that's uncomfortable.\n\n**The job anxiety being scarier:**\n\nYou said the job question is making you more anxious than the meeting thing ever did. That's because the meeting anxiety had a clear shape\u2014you knew what the problem was, and you had tools to work with it. This is different. This is you realizing that the anxiety was just the surface, and underneath it was something you hadn't had to face yet: the possibility that you're in the wrong place entirely. That's a bigger unknown, and your brain doesn't like unknowns. It would rather be anxious about the meeting than face the uncertainty of \"what if I am in the wrong place?\"\n\nBut here's the thing: you're not stalling or pretending everything's fine. You're noticing that something isn't working, and you're naming that. That's not avoidance\u2014that's just information. The fact that it's scary doesn't mean you're doing something wrong. It means you're facing something real.\n\n**What to do:**\n\nYou asked: \"is it like... quit? or try to fix my relationship with it? or what?\" And honestly? You don't have to decide that right now. You're allowed to just sit with the question without needing to answer it immediately. But here's what might help: instead of asking \"should I quit or fix it?\" try asking \"what do I actually need from work right now, and what am I getting?\"\n\nThat's a different question. It takes you away from the binary of quit/fix and gives you room to explore what's actually missing. What would it look like to have more of what you need? What would it take to get it? And if you can't get it, what does that tell you about where you are and where you want to be?\n\nYou don't have to decide anything today. But I think the next step is to start exploring what \"I need\" actually means in this context. That's the question that's waiting for you."

Some days you want more autonomy, some days you want to feel like what you're doing matters. Both of those things matter, and the fact that they're showing up in different ways tells you something: the problem isn't that you're asking the wrong question. It's that you're not in a place where any one thing is clearly missing. You're in a place where multiple things are out of balance, and they're shifting depending on what you're paying attention to.\n\nThat's not a sign that you're confused or that the question is broken. That's just what it looks like when you're trying to figure out what's actually missing when the context is complex.\n\n**The lunch and feeling excited:**\n\nThat moment with your coworker\u2014genuinely excited about the new initiative, actually interested in what they were saying, feeling engaged\u2014that's not stupid. That's your system telling you something real. You've been looking for that for a while, and it showed up because you found something that felt like it was yours.

And now you're wondering if that means you need to look for something else or if you're being ungrateful or unrealistic. Here's what I think: you're not being ungrateful. You're just noticing that the bar for what you need has shifted. A few months ago, \"fine\" might have been enough. Now, it's not. That's not a personal failing\u2014that's just what happens when you grow and your standards change.\n\nThe environment is probably part of it, but it's not the whole story. It's more like: the environment has things that are okay, but it's not giving you the things that actually matter to you anymore. And that's a real thing to notice. You don't have to decide right now whether that means you need to leave or whether there's something you can do to shift the environment. But you're allowed to just notice: \"something is missing here, and I need to figure out what it is.\"\n\n**Your mom's call:**\n\nShe asked if you want to come visit again soon\u2014just her, without the family stuff.
