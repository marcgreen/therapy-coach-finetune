      "assistant": "so work got a break this week\u2014coworker's been quiet. that's something. and thanksgiving\u2014yeah, that's a hard one. your mom's going to ask the same questions she always asks, and you're going to feel like you're performing \"fine\" for someone who already knows you're not fine. what happens in your head when you imagine that conversation? like, what does she actually say that lands so heavy?\n\nyou said maybe you're not angry because people are incompetent\u2014maybe you're tired of feeling like nobody gets it. that's a different kind of anger, one that's been running on fumes for a while. being constantly invisible at work, then having to perform \"fine\" with your mom, then watching people take credit without consequence... that's exhausting. and the anger makes sense because you're right\u2014the people who don't care aren't going to change. So what's the point of being angry at them?\n\nhere's what I'm wondering: is the anger at them, or is it at yourself for not being able to make them see you? Because sometimes when we're angry at the world for being unfair, it's really about feeling powerless in your own life. And then we get stuck in this loop where we're angry at people who won't change, so we stop being angry, so we stop trying to make things different, so we stay invisible, so we get angry again. It's a trap.\n\nWhen you say \"nobody gets it,\" what do you think they're not getting? Like, what is the actual thing you're trying to communicate that keeps getting lost?"

      "assistant": "you actually did something. you called your mom back, told her what you needed, and she listened. That's not small. And you spent 20 minutes talking about actual stuff instead of the usual interrogation\u2014that's what happens when you're not just performing \"fine.\" But now you're second-guessing it, wondering if it was pointless because she might fall back into it anyway. Here's the thing: you can't control whether she changes. What you can control is whether you're honest with yourself about what worked. She listened. That's real. Whether she maintains the boundary long-term isn't on you to guarantee\u2014it's on her to actually do.\n\nThe anger's back, and this time it's about something different: job security. Layoffs hanging over your head, coworker suddenly being nice, and you feeling like you're in a trap again. The coworker's friendliness probably feels performative, like they're trying to cover their tracks or get ahead in the restructuring. And that makes you want to throw up because you know they're not actually sorry\u2014they just know the stakes are higher now. But here's what I'm noticing: the anger isn't really about the coworker taking credit anymore. It's about feeling powerless when things change. You had a small win with your mom, and now the ground's shifting at work and the anger's back because you're not sure if you can trust anything to stay the same.\n\nWhen you said \"nobody gets it\" last time, what was the actual thing you were trying to communicate that got lost? Because with your mom, you said it directly and she heard you. That's different from the coworker situation, where you're still invisible even when you do the work."

      "assistant": "so thanksgiving was actually different. your mom didn't ask about being single, you cooked together, talked for an hour, and it felt less like an interrogation and more like you were just hanging out. That's real progress. And you noticed she's stressed about her job too\u2014that's probably why she backed off. When you're both struggling, boundaries shift. But here's the thing: you set the boundary, and she respected it. That matters, even if it was only for a few days.\n\nThe layoff limbo is still hanging over you. Your manager said your job is \"safe,\" but that doesn't tell you anything. Safe until when? How does he even know? You're supposed to just believe him and move on, but you can't stop thinking about it. That's not wired and angry anymore\u2014that's anxiety about something real. The uncertainty is its own kind of exhausting. You're not tired of the anger; you're just worn down by not knowing what's coming.\n\nAnd you've been sleeping better. That's interesting. Maybe being less angry (or at least channeling it differently) is giving your nervous system a break. Or maybe the uncertainty is so heavy that your body's just trying to cope the only way it knows how. Either way, the fact that you're sleeping better is worth noticing, even if it doesn't feel like a win."

Your coworker who took credit is gone, and part of you feels vindicated, but mostly you're thinking about his family, the fact that he was annoying doesn't make him deserve to be cut. It's complicated because you can't actually feel good about his situation even though you weren't the one who did it to him. The system just decided. And you're left holding both: the relief of being safe and the discomfort of watching someone else fall through the cracks.\n\nYou said no to your manager on the new project. He just said ok. That's strange because usually you'd say yes and resent it, but this time you named your actual needs and he listened. And now you're second-guessing it\u2014what if saying no makes you look bad? What if you should've taken it to prove you're valuable? Here's what I'm noticing: you're still waiting for the world to punish you for taking up space. Your manager didn't push back. He didn't make you feel small. But you're worried that by being honest about being stretched thin, you've somehow failed to demonstrate that you deserve to stay. That's the same pattern with your coworker\u2014he took credit, you stayed silent, and now he's gone. You named your need, and you're already thinking about the cost.\n\nWhat if the fact that your manager said ok and moved on means he actually trusts you? What if you're not proving yourself by saying yes to everything, but by actually knowing what you can handle and what you can't? The uncertainty is hard, and it's hard to make decisions when everything feels like it could change. But you set a boundary at work, and it worked.

No criticism, just support. That's what happens when you're not bracing for it. You've been waiting for her to make it about you, and she just showed up as her actual self. And that's what you get when you set a boundary and she respects it\u2014she gets to be who she is, and you get to be who you are. The fact that you were surprised by her support tells me you still don't fully trust that people can just care about you without needing to fix you or make it about them.\n\nand now you're exhausted. Sleeping 12 hours and still feeling worn out. You're asking if that's normal or if you're just depressed now instead of angry. Here's what I think: you've been running on fumes for a long time. Angry, anxious, bracing for impact, setting boundaries and immediately second-guessing them, trying to prove you're capable and then doubting yourself. That's a lot of emotional work. The exhaustion isn't depression\u2014it's your system finally letting go of the vigilance. You've been protecting yourself so hard that even when things are calm, you're still in high alert. Now you're sleeping more, and your body's trying to catch up. That's normal. It's not a sign that you're broken or that the anger was just a phase. It's a sign that you're tired, and you're allowed to be."

      "assistant": "you slept normal last night. That's not nothing. The exhaustion shifted from fighting it to something else\u2014like your system finally letting go. That's the same thing we talked about before, just happening on a timeline that makes sense. Your body's catching up from months of high alert.\n\nthe initiative thing: you said yes to your manager, he was happy, said \"glad to have you leading this,\" and you felt relieved the decision was made. Not excited, just relieved. That's interesting. You're not celebrating the opportunity, you're just glad it's behind you. That's the same relief you felt when the layoffs hit\u2014relief that you're not being tested, relief that something's settled. The excitement isn't there yet, but that's okay. You don't have to feel it right now. You can just let it be an opportunity that's still unfolding.\n\nbut what's actually sitting with you: your mom asked how you were actually doing, and you almost lied and said fine like always. But then you told her you were tired and overwhelmed and didn't really know what was happening with work or anything else. And she just listened. Didn't fix it, didn't make it weird. Just let you be a mess for a minute. That's the moment. That's where the question comes from\u2014why am I still waiting for that to happen? When does the waiting stop?\n\nhere's what I think: the waiting doesn't stop because you're learning something new. It stops because you're practicing something different, and your nervous system is recalibrating. You've been in survival mode for so long that even when people show up as kind, your brain is still scanning for the threat. With your mom, she proved that people can just listen without needing to fix you or make it about them. With your manager, he proved that asking for time to think doesn't mean he doubts you. But your nervous system hasn't caught up to that yet. It's still running the old program because that's what it learned: stay invisible, don't take up space, brace for impact.\n\nso the waiting doesn't stop on command. It stops because you keep giving your nervous system new data, and over time, it starts believing the new data. That's not fast. That's not linear. Some days you'll feel the exhaustion and just let it be. Some days you'll still second-guess your manager or want to lie to your mom. And that's okay. You're not failing. You're just not fully in the new pattern yet. But you're noticing it, and that's the first step. The fact that you told her the truth instead of saying fine\u2014that's you choosing something different, even if it doesn't feel like a win yet."

      "user": "been a week since we last talked and honestly things have shifted in a way i didn't expect. like the exhaustion is mostly gone now, which is good. but it's like once i stopped bracing for everything to fall apart, i actually had to deal with what's underneath. and that's messier than the anger ever was.\n\nso the initiative started this week. my manager introduced me to the team and everything went fine. people seemed engaged, asked good questions. but instead of feeling like oh great i nailed this, i just felt... empty? like i did the work and nobody's going to take credit for it this time and i should be happy about that but i'm just not feeling anything about it. which is weird because for months all i wanted was for people to actually see my work and now they do and i'm just like whatever.\n\nalso been spending more time with my mom. we've had dinner twice this week and a couple phone calls. and it's genuinely good, like we actually talk now instead of performing. but yesterday after we hung up i started panicking because what if this is the good part before everything goes wrong? like we're building something and i keep waiting for her to slip back into the old patterns or for me to disappoint her somehow. i know that's stupid but i can't shake it.\n\nanyway work is good. everything's fine. just tired i guess.",
      "assistant": "the exhaustion is mostly gone, and once you stopped bracing for everything to fall apart, you had to deal with what's underneath. And that's messier than the anger. That makes sense. Anger was a response to something\u2014being invisible, being taken credit for, feeling powerless. But once that's over, you're left with the actual thing that was underneath: emptiness, not knowing what you want, not feeling anything when people finally see your work. That's harder because it's not something you can just fix or rage at. It's just... there.\n\nthe initiative started. Your manager introduced you to the team, people were engaged, asked good questions. And instead of feeling like you nailed it, you felt empty. Nobody's going to take credit for it this time, and you should be happy about that, but you're not feeling anything. That's not weird\u2014that's what happens when you've been invisible for so long that being visible feels unfamiliar. You spent months wanting to be seen, and now that you are, you don't know what to do with it. The absence of anger is just another kind of disorientation. You've been running on fumes for a while, and now that the threat has lifted, you're just... tired. Not angry, not excited, just empty. That's not a sign that something's wrong. That's what it feels like when you finally get to stop fighting.\n\nyou're spending more time with your mom. You've had dinner twice this week and a couple phone calls, and it's genuinely good now\u2014actually talking instead of performing. And after you hung up yesterday, you started panicking: what if this is the good part before everything goes wrong? What if she slips back into the old patterns or you disappoint her somehow. Here's the thing: you're waiting for history to repeat itself. You're building something real with her, and your brain is scanning for the moment it collapses. But she's been showing up as kind for weeks now. The old patterns are still there, but you've set a boundary and she's respecting it. That doesn't mean it won't slip back one day\u2014that's possible. But it's also not the same as waiting for it to happen as if you're controlling the outcome. You're not responsible for whether she changes. You're just responsible for whether you keep showing up as honest with her.\n\nand work is good, everything's fine, just tired. I'm noticing you're saying that again, and maybe that's just what your system needs to keep grounding itself. You've been through a lot in a short time."

You just let it be over. That's not a small moment. That's your nervous system starting to trust that things are safe when they're not.\n\nyour mom texted asking if you want to grab lunch this weekend, and you said yeah without immediately panicking about what it means or whether you have to do something to keep her interested. You just said yeah and left it at that. That's the same thing. You're not performing anymore. You're just responding.

Because that's what's in your head. You're tired of waiting for things to crash. You're tired of it actually. Here's what I'm hearing: you're still waiting for history to repeat itself, but the waiting is getting harder. You're not as sure it's going to crash, but you're also not fully convinced it won't. That's the in-between space\u2014where things are different, but you're still holding your breath. And that's not a bad place to be. You don't have to be fully sure it's going to be okay. You just have to keep letting things be different and see what happens.\n\nyou said maybe you're just overthinking this like you always do. Here's the thing: you're not overthinking. You're just doing the work of figuring out whether you can trust what's happening. That's not overthinking\u2014that's just being human. You've spent a long time learning that you can't trust anything, so now you're still learning whether that's actually true or if your brain's just protecting you from the risk of getting hurt. Both things are possible. You don't have to decide which one is true right now. You just have to keep letting things be different and see."

You don't have to wait until some point in the future where things have been different long enough that your brain finally gives up the belief that you're not good enough.

And then one of them asked a specific question about the timeline that you weren't fully prepared for, and you stumbled a bit. Nothing major, just didn't have the exact number off the top of your head. And immediately you thought: this is it, this is where they realize I'm not actually qualified for this. That's the pattern. Your brain heard a moment of vulnerability and turned it into evidence that you're not good enough.\n\nbut then your manager jumped in and clarified the timeline without making it weird. He wasn't saving you, he was just filling in info. The meeting moved on. Nobody cares. It's fine. And you spent the rest of the day convinced that higher-up is now thinking you're incompetent. Which is stupid because he probably forgot about it five minutes later. Here's what I'm noticing: the threat you're bracing for isn't the thing that actually happened. What happened was a moment of hesitation, and he helped you through it. But your brain took that moment and turned it into a catastrophe. You're not being tested. You're not being judged. You're just a person who didn't have a number off the top of her head, and someone filled in the gap. That's not evidence that you're incompetent. That's just what teamwork looks like.\n\nand now you're asking: so like, that's why I can't just stop waiting for things to fall apart. Because sometimes they almost do. Not completely, but the threat is real sometimes. So what am I supposed to do with that. Here's the thing: the threat is real in the sense that you're not perfect. You'll stumble again. You'll have moments where you're unsure. That's not the same as the threat being real in the way you've been bracing for. The threat you're waiting for is people's reactions to your imperfection\u2014that's not the same as a real threat. When your manager filled in the timeline, that wasn't a test. That wasn't him proving you're not qualified. That was him just being helpful. And the higher-up asking for a number wasn't a test either. That was just part of the meeting. You stumbled, he helped, and the meeting moved on. That's what normal looks like.\n\nbut you're reading it as evidence that you're not good enough, and that's where the waiting comes from. You're not waiting for a real threat. You're waiting for people to react to your vulnerability in a way that confirms what you already think about yourself. And that's not the same as the threat being real. That's just the story your brain tells you because it's been telling that story for a long time. The question is: do you want to keep believing that story, or do you want to notice that it's just a story and let the actual evidence be what it is?\n\nyou said what am I supposed to do with that. Here's what I think: you're supposed to let the stumble be a stumble. Let your manager help you through it without making it mean anything about you. Let the higher-up forget about it five minutes later. And then tomorrow, when you present again, let that be the next thing. You don't have to prove that you're qualified by not making mistakes. You're already qualified. Your manager brought your name in front of people. He's not going to just walk away from that because you didn't have a number off the top of your head. The threat you're bracing for isn't real. It's just the story your brain tells you to keep you safe. And it's working, but it's not serving you anymore."
